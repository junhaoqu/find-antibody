## This is the short Python script about finding keywords in a directory for all pdf
1. First you should have Python environment
2. For this script, we will use the PyMuPDF library (fitz module) for reading PDF files and extracting text. Install it using `pip install PyMuPDF` in Terminal.

4. You could add keywords in the `keywords`, eg `keywords = ["lgr5", "anti-lgr5", "lgr5 primary antibody"]`
