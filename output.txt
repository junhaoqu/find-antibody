The intestinalepithelium is the most rapidly self-renewingtissue in
adult mammals. We have recently demonstrated the presence of
about six cycling Lgr51 stem cells at the bottoms of small-intestinal
crypts1. Here we describe the establishment of long-term culture
conditions under which single crypts undergo multiple crypt
fission events, while simultanously generating villus-like epithelial
domains in which all differentiated cell types are present. Single
sorted Lgr51 stem cells can also initiate these crypt–villus
organoids. Tracing experiments indicate that the Lgr51 stem-cell
hierarchy is maintained in organoids. We conclude that intestinal
crypt–villus units are self-organizing structures, which can be built
from a single stem cell in the absence of a non-epithelial cellular
niche.
The self-renewing epithelium of the small intestine is ordered into
crypts and villi2. Cells are newly generated in the crypts and are lost by
apoptosis at the tips of the villi, with a turnover time of 5 days in the
mouse. Self-renewing stem cells have long been known to reside near
the crypt bottom and to produce the rapidly proliferating transit
amplifying (TA) cells. The estimated number of stem cells is between
four and six per crypt. Enterocytes, goblet cells and enteroendocrine
cells develop from TA cells and continue their migration in coherent
bands along the crypt–villus axis. The fourth major differentiated cell
type, the Paneth cell, resides at the crypt bottom. We have recently
identified a gene, Lgr5, that is specifically expressed in cycling crypt
base columnar (CBC) cells that are interspersed between the Paneth
cells1. Using a mouse in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP)/
tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase cassette was integrated into
the Lgr5 locus, we showed by lineage tracing that the Lgr51 cells
constitute multipotent stem cells that generate all cell types of the
epithelium1, even when assessed 14 months after induction of Cre3.
Although a variety of culture systems have been described4–7, no
long-term culture system has been established that maintains basic
crypt–villus physiology2. Weattemptedto designsuch a culture system
by combining previously defined insights in the growth requirements
of intestinal epithelium. First, Wnt signalling is a pivotal requirement
for crypt proliferation8–10 and the Wnt agonist R-spondin 1 induces
marked crypt hyperplasia in vivo11. Second, signalling by epidermal
growth factor (EGF) is associated with intestinal proliferation12.
Third, transgenic expression of Noggin induces an expansion of crypt
numbers13. Fourth, isolated intestinal cells undergo anoikis outside the
normal tissue context14. Because laminin (a1 and a2) is enriched at the
crypt base15, we explored the use of laminin-rich Matrigel to support
intestinal epithelial growth. Matrigel-based cultures have been used
successfully for the growth of mammary epithelium16.
MousecryptpreparationsweresuspendedinMatrigel.Cryptgrowth
required EGF and R-spondin 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Passaging
revealed a requirement for Noggin (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The
cultured crypts behaved in a stereotypical manner (Fig. 1a; Supple-
mentary Movie 1). The upper opening rapidly became sealed, and
the lumen filled with apoptotic cells. The crypt region underwent
continuous budding events, reminiscent of crypt fission17. Paneth cells
were always present at the bud site. Most crypts could be cultured
(Fig. 1b). Further expansion created organoids, comprising more than
40 crypt domains surrounding a central lumen lined by a villus-like
epithelium (‘villus domain’) (Fig. 1c–e). Staining with E-cadherin
revealed a single cell layer (Supplementary Fig. 2). At weekly intervals,
organoids were mechanically dissociated and replated at one-fifth of
the pre-plating density. Organoids were cultured for more than 8
months
without
losing
the
characteristics
described
below.
Expression analysis by microarray revealed that organoids remained
highly similar to freshly isolated small-intestinal crypts, for instance
when compared with fresh colon crypts (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Moreover, nosignificantinduction of stress-relatedgeneswasobserved
(Supplementary Table 1).
Culture of Lgr5–EGFP–ires–CreERT2 crypts revealed Lgr5–GFP1
stem cells intermingled with Paneth cells at the crypt base. Wnt
activation, as demonstrated by nuclear b-catenin (Supplementary
Figs 4a and 9) and expression of the Wnt target genes Lgr5 (Fig. 1d)
and EphB2 (ref. 18) (Supplementary Fig. 4b), was confined to the
crypts. Apoptotic cells were shed into the central lumen, a process
reminiscent of the shedding of apopotic cells at villus tips in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Metaphase spreads of organoids more than
3 months old consistently revealed 40 chromosomes in each cell
(n 5 20) (Supplementary Fig. 4d). We found no evidence for the
presence of myofibroblasts or other non-epithelial cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5).
We cultured crypts from Lgr5–EGFP–ires–CreERT2 mice crossed
with the Cre-activatable Rosa26–LacZ reporter to allow lineage tracing.
Directly after induction with low-dose tamoxifen, we noted single
labelled cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e, g). More than 90% of these
generatedentirelyblue crypts(Supplementary Fig.4e–g), implyingthat
theLgr5–GFP1 cellsdidindeed retain stem cellproperties.Crypts from
the Cre-activatable Rosa26–YFP reporter19,20 mouse allowed lineage
tracing by confocal analysis. Directly after treatment with tamoxifen,
we noted single labelled cells that induced lineage tracing over the
following days, both in freshly isolated crypts (Supplementary Fig.
6a–c) and in established organoids (Supplementary Fig. 6d).
Supplementary Movie 2 represents four days of lineage tracing, reveal-
ing green Lgr51 cells and YFP1 offspring (pseudocolour red) against
the backdrop of a growing organoid.
Recently, mammary gland epithelial structures were established
from single stem cells in vitro 21. When single Lgr5–GFPhi cells were
sorted, these died immediately. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632,
which inhibits anoikis of embryonic stem cells22, significantly

decreased this cell death. Because cell-to-cell Notch signalling is
essential to maintain proliferative crypts23, we also provided a
Notch-agonistic peptide24. Under these conditions, significant num-
bers of Lgr5–GFPhi cells survived and formed large crypt organoids.
Organoids formed rarely when GFPlow daughter cells were seeded
(Fig. 2d). Multiple Lgr5–GFPhi cells were intermingled with Paneth
cells at crypt bottoms (Fig. 2e, f). Incorporation of 5-ethynyl-29-
deoxyuridine (EdU, a thymidine analogue) revealed S-phase cells
in the crypts (Fig. 2g).
We sorted cells at one cell per well, visually verified the presence of
singlecellsandfollowedtheresultinggrowth.Ineachoffourindividual
experiments, we identified and followed 100 single cells. On average,
about 6% of theLgr5–GFP hi cells grew out into organoids,whereas the
remaining cells typically died within the first 12h, presumably as a
result of physical and/or biological stress inherent in the isolation
procedure. GFPlow cells rarely grew out (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b and
Supplementary Fig. 7 illustrate the growth of an organoid from a single
Lgr5–GFPhi cell. By four days of culture, the structures consisted of
about 100 cells, which is consistent with the 12-h cell cycle of pro-
liferative crypt cells25 (Fig. 3c). After 2 weeks, the organoids were dis-
sociated into single cells and replated to form new organoids (Fig. 3d).
This procedure could be repeated at least four times on a two-weekly
basis, without apparent loss of replating efficiency.
The organoids derived from single stem cells were indistinguishable
in appearance from those derived from whole crypts. Paneth cells and
stem cells were located at crypt bottoms (Figs 2e, f and 4c, g). Fully
polarized enterocytes, as demonstrated by villin1 mature brush
borders and apical alkaline phosphatase, lined the central lumen
(Fig. 4a, e, i). Goblet cells (Muc21, Fig. 4b; periodic acid–Schiff
(PAS)1, Fig. 4f) and enteroendocrine cells (chromogranin A1,
Fig. 4d; synaptophysin1, Fig. 4h) were scattered throughout the orga-
noid structure. Four types of mature cell were recognized by electron
microscopy (Fig. 4i–l). Non-epithelial (stromal/mesenchymal) cells
were absent, an observation confirmed by electron-microscopic
imaging (Fig. 4i–p and Supplementary Fig. 8c–g). Both the crypts
(Fig. 4m–o) and the central luminal epithelium (Fig. 4p) consisted
of a single layer of polarized epithelial cells resting directly on
the Matrigel support. High-resolution images of these electron-
microscopic pictures are given in SupplementaryFig. 9. We frequently
noted small intercellular vacuoles, possibly an indicator of culture-
induced or fixation-induced stress (Fig. 4i–p and Supplementary
Fig. 8).

It is well known that epithelial crypts are in intimate contact with
subepithelial myofibroblasts26–28, and it is generally believed that the
latter cells create a specialized cellular niche at crypt bottoms27,29,30.
Suchanichewouldcreatea uniqueenvironmenttoanchorandsupport
the intestinal stem cells. We now show that a self-renewing epithelium
can be established by a limited set of growth signals that are uniformly
presented. Despite this, the isolated stem cells autonomously generate
asymmetry in a highly stereotypical fashion. This rapidly leads to the
formation of crypt-like structures with de novo generated stem cells and
Paneth cells located at their bottoms and filled with TA cells. These
crypt-like structures feed into villus-like luminal domains consisting
of postmitotic enterocytes, in which apoptotic cells pinch off into the
lumen in a manner reminiscent of cell lossat villus tips.Theparadoxical
observation that single cells exposed to a uniform growth-promoting
environment can generate asymmetric structures is particularly evident

on scrutiny of the Wnt pathway. Although all cells are exposed to
R-spondin 1, only cells in crypts display hallmarks of active Wnt
signalling; that is, nuclear b-catenin and the expression of Wnt target
genes. Apparently, differential responsiveness to Wnt signalling rather
than differential exposure to extracellular Wnt signals lies at the heartof
the formation of a crypt–villus axis.
We conclude that a single Lgr51 intestinal stem cell can operate
independently of positional cues from its environment and that it can
generate a continuously expanding, self-organizing epithelial structure
reminiscent of normal gut. The culture system described will simplify
the study of stem-cell-driven crypt–villus biology. Moreover, it may
open up new avenues for regenerative medicine and gene therapy.
METHODS SUMMARY
Mice. Outbred mice 6–12 weeks old were used. Generation and genotyping of
the Lgr5–EGFP–Ires–CreERT2 allele1 has been described previously3. Rosa26–
lacZ or YFP–Cre reporter mice were obtained from Jackson Labs.
Crypt isolation, cell dissociation and cell culture. Crypts were released from
murine small intestine by incubation for 30 min at 4 uC in PBS containing 2 mM
EDTA (Supplementary Methods). Isolated crypts were counted and pelleted. A
totalof500cryptsweremixedwith50 mlofMatrigel(BDBioscience)andplatedin
24-well plates. After polymerization of Matrigel, 500ml of crypt culture medium
(Advanced DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen)) containing growth factors (10–50 ng ml21
EGF (Peprotech), 500ng ml21 R-spondin 1 (ref. 11) and 100ng ml21 Noggin
(Peprotech)) was added. For sorting experiments, isolated crypts were incubated
inculture mediumfor45 minat 37 uC, followedby triturationwith a glass pipette.
Dissociated cells were passed through cell strainer with a pore size of 20 mm.
GFPhi, GFPlow and GFP2 cells were sorted by flow cytometry (MoFlo; Dako).
Single viable epithelial cells were gated by forward scatter, side scatter and pulse-
width parameter, and by negative staining for propidium iodide. Sorted cells were
collectedin crypt culture medium and embedded in Matrigel containing Jagged-1
peptide (1 mM; AnaSpec) at 1 cell per well (in 96-well plates, 5 ml Matrigel). Crypt
culture medium (250 ml for 48-well plates, 100 ml for 96-well plates) containing
Y-27632(10 mM)wasoverlaid.Growthfactorswere added everyotherdayand the
entire medium was changed every 4 days. For passage, organoids were removed
from Matrigel and mechanically dissociated into single-crypt domains, and then
transferred to fresh Matrigel. Passage was performed every 1–2 weeks with a 1:5
split ratio.

Identification of stem cells in small
intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5

The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue in adult mammals. It is currently believed that four to six
crypt stem cells reside at the 14 position immediately above the Paneth cells in the small intestine; colon stem cells
remain undefined. Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5, also known as Gpr49) was selected
from a panel of intestinal Wnt target genes for its restricted crypt expression. Here, using two knock-in alleles, we reveal
exclusive expression of Lgr5 in cycling columnar cells at the crypt base. In addition, Lgr5 was expressed in rare cells in
several other tissues. Using an inducible Cre knock-in allele and the Rosa26-lacZ reporter strain, lineage-tracing experiments
were performed in adult mice. The Lgr5-positive crypt base columnar cell generated all epithelial lineages over a 60-day
period, suggesting that it represents the stem cell of the small intestine and colon. The expression pattern of Lgr5 suggests
that it marks stem cells in multiple adult tissues and cancers.
The absorptive epithelium of the small intestine is ordered into crypts
and villi1, which in the mouse turn over every three to five days. The
massive rate of cell production in the crypts is balanced by apoptosis
at the tips of the villi. Until now, intestinal stem cells have not been
functionally identified owing to the lack of unique markers and the
absence of stem-cell assays. The analysis of mouse chimaeras and
mutagen-induced somatic clones2,3 as well as the study of regenera-
tion after injury have allowed an operational definition of stem-cell
characteristics. Self-renewing stem cells cycle steadily to produce
the rapidly proliferating transit-amplifying cells capable of differenti-
ating towards all lineages. The estimated number of stem cells is
between four and six per crypt2. Long-term DNA-label retention
has tentatively located stem cells at ‘position 14’ directly above the
Paneth cells4. Three differentiated cell types (enterocytes, goblet cells
and enteroendocrine cells) form from transit-amplifying cells at the
crypt–villus junction and continue their migration in coherent bands
stretching along the crypt–villus axis. Each villus receives cells from
multiple different crypts. The fourth principal differentiated cell type,
the Paneth cell, resides at the crypt bottom. The colon epithelium
contains crypts, but has a flat surface rather than carrying villi. This
epithelium comprises two main differentiated cell types: the absorp-
tive colonocytes and the goblet cells1. Until now, no stem cells have
been identified in the colon.
Lgr5 is expressed in crypt base columnar cells
Because Wnt signals constitute the principal driving force behind the
biology of the crypt5, we hypothesized that some Wnt target genes
may be specifically expressed in the stem cells. We have previously
described the Wnt target gene programme in human colorectal can-
cer cells and found that it is physiologically expressed in intestinal
crypts6,7. Of approximately 80 selected Wnt target genes7, most were
expressed in either Paneth cells or transit-amplifying cells. The LGR5
gene, however, was expressed in a unique fashion. It behaved as a Wnt
target gene, because its expression was extinguished on the induced
inhibition of Wnt pathway activity by dominant-negative TCF4 in
a cell system described earlier6 (Fig. 1a, lane 1 versus 2). Accordingly,

the gene was expressed in the crypts, but not the villi, of mouse
small intestine (Fig. 1a, lane 3 versus 4). In situ hybridization revealed
expression in a limited number of cells located at all crypt bottoms as
well as in adenomas in the small intestine of an ApcMin (a mutant
allele of Apc as present in multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice)
mouse (Fig. 1b, c). This expression pattern, enlarged in Fig. 2c, clearly
differed from that obtained with a Paneth-cell-specific gene (Fig. 2a)
or a transit-amplifying-specific gene (Fig. 2b). The Lgr5 gene seemed
to mark the cycling crypt base columnar (CBC) cells, interspersed
between Paneth cells (Fig. 2d–h).
Lgr5 encodes an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, character-
ized by a large leucine-rich extracellular domain8. Lgr5 was on our
original list of Wnt targets in colorectal cancer6, but has since been
observed in ovarian and hepatocellular carcinomas9,10. To study its
expression in detail, we obtained a knock-in allele, in which lacZ,
preceded by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), is integrated
just amino-terminal to the first transmembrane domain essentially
creating a null allele (Fig. 3a).
The Lgr52/2 phenotype was described in ref. 11. A malformation
of the tongue and lower jaw causes newborn mutants to swallow air,
leading to their death soon after birth. We observed the same pheno-
type. Of note, crypts and intestinal stem cells are first established
several weeks after birth12. The generation of heterozygous Lgr5-
lacZ mice allowed us to detail the expression of Lgr5. Before birth,
a dynamic and complex expression pattern was observed (N. Barker
et al., manuscript in preparation). Around birth, Lgr5 expression
subsided in virtually all tissues. Expression in adult mice was
restricted to rare, scattered cells in the eye, brain, hair follicle, mam-
mary gland, reproductive organs, stomach and intestinal tract (Fig. 3,
and not shown). In the small intestine, Lgr5 expression was observed
in slender cells at the bottom of small intestinal (Fig. 3b, c) and colon
(Fig. 3d, e) crypts. Counting of blue cells in small-intestinal crypts

sectioned through the lumen revealed the presence of approximately
3.5 of such cells per sectioned crypt (Fig. 2i, white bar). More than
30 yr ago, ref. 13 noted the presence of cycling cells between the
Paneth cells; these were named ‘crypt base columnar’ cells. It has
been proposed that these cells may harbour stem-cell activity2,14,15.
Lgr51 CBC cells are actively cycling
By morphology, the slender Lgr51 CBC cells with their scant cyto-
plasm and wedge-shaped nuclei pointing towards the crypt lumen
were readily distinguishable from the adjacent Paneth cells. The
CBC cells were frequently positive for the proliferation marker
Ki67 (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1) and also occasionally
expressed the M-phase marker phospho-histone H3, indicating
that the cells are typically cycling (Fig. 2f). Indeed, a 4-h pulse of
5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelled approximately one of these
cells per crypt section (Fig. 2g and i, left black bar), whereas a 24-h
continuous BrdU labelling resulted in more than three positive cells
per crypt section (Fig. 2h and i, right black bar), close to the total
number of CBC cells per crypt section (Fig. 2i, white bar). This
observation implied that the average cycling time of CBC cells is in
the order of one day.
Unique ultrastructural anatomy of Lgr5–EGFP1 CBC cells
To visualize live CBC cells and to study their potential ‘stemness’, we
generated another knock-in allele, by integrating an enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP)-IRES-creERT2 cassette at the first ATG
codon (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Heterozygous mice were
healthy and fertile. The GFP pattern observed in adult tissues faith-
fully recapitulated the pattern previously seen with the Lgr5-lacZ
allele (data not shown, and Fig. 4). Confocal imaging allowed the
visualization of the Lgr51 cells by GFP fluorescence in small intestine
(Fig. 4b, c, e) and colon (Fig. 4f). A three-dimensional reconstruction
of the crypt in Fig. 4e (Supplementary Movie 1) illustrated the
wedge-like shape of the CBC cells. Immuno-electron microscopy
using immunogold labelling of the GFP-positive CBC cells and of
neighbouring Paneth cells and fibroblasts illustrated the unique
ultrastructural anatomy of the CBC cells (Fig. 4g, h). Typically, the
CBC cells were relatively broad at their base, contained a flat, wedge-
shaped nucleus and scarce organelles. A slender extension of apical
cytoplasm was squeezed in-between neighbouring endoplasmic-
reticulum- and granule-rich Paneth cells, extended to the crypt
lumen and carried some apical microvilli.
We then crossed the EGFP-IRES-creERT2 knock-in allele with
the Cre-activatable Rosa26-lacZ reporter16 (Fig. 4a). Injection of
tamoxifen activates the CreERT2 fusion enzyme in Lgr5-expressing
cells. Cre-mediated excision of the roadblock sequence in the Rosa26-
lacZ reporter should then irreversibly mark Lgr51 cells. Moreover,
although potential progeny of these cells will no longer express GFP,
the activated lacZ reporter should act as a genetic marker, facilitating
lineage tracing.
Lgr51 CBC cells are distinct from the 14 cells
Expression of lacZ was not observed in non-induced mice (not
shown). To visualize in the crypts the location of CBC cells in which
the latent Cre enzyme could be activated by tamoxifen, we treated
2–3-month-old mice with tamoxifen and killed the mice 12-h later.
As evident in Fig. 5a, blue LacZ signals appeared at the typical CBC
positions. We determined the frequency at which the blue cells
appeared at specific positions relative to the crypt bottom, according
to the scheme in Fig. 5b. Most of the Cre1, LacZ-labelled CBC cells
occurred at positions between the Paneth cells, whereas only 10% of
these cells were observed at the 14 position (Fig. 5b, blue line).
Quantitative data on the position of long-term DNA-label-retaining
cells obtained in adult mice after irradiation (marking the ‘14’
intestinal stem cell) were published recently17. Comparison of these
data (Fig. 5b, red line) with the position of CBC cells harbouring
activatable Cre revealed that the two markers identified largely non-
overlapping cell populations.
Another defining characteristic of the 14 cells is their exquisite
sensitivity to low-dose (,1 Gy) radiation4. To compare relative
radiation sensitivity between CBC cells and 14 cells, adult mice were
irradiated with 1 Gy or 10 Gy and were killed 6 h later at the peak
of apoptosis. Active caspase-3-positive cells were visualized by
immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The frequency of
caspase-3-positive cells per crypt was determined by counting

apoptotic cells in three classes: CBC cells (defined by their location
between the Paneth cells), 14 cells (located directly above the Paneth
cells) and transit-amplifying cells (located at position 5–15, Sup-
plementary Fig. 3b). Maximal apoptosis at the 14 position was
already reached at 1 Gy (Supplementary Fig. 3a, upper panel, black
arrows) in concordance with ref. 4, whereas 10 Gy caused signifi-
cantly more apoptosis than 1-Gy irradiation in CBC (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a, lower panel, white arrows) and transit-amplifying cells,
confirming the different identities of the CBC and 14 cells.
Lgr51 CBC cells are the small intestinal stem cells
Adult mice were then subjected to a tamoxifen pulse and were killed at
1 day (Fig. 5c), 5 days (Fig. 5d), 12days, 35days (not shown) and
60days after induction (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 4). One day
after induction, occasional CBC cells in small intestine and colon
expressed LacZ (Fig. 5c, i). As is demonstrated for whole-mount small
intestine in Supplementary Fig. 4, parallel ribbons of cells emanated
from thecryptbottoms and ran upthe sideof adjacent villi at later time
points. For each of the time points, 200 crypts were counted in the
proximal small intestine to determine the percentage containing blue
cells. After 1 day, 5 days, 35days and 60 days, these numbers were 22%,
39%, 25% and 36%, respectively. Thus, all CBC cells seemed capable of
long-term maintenance of the self-renewing epithelium.
Double-labelling of 60-d-induced intestine revealed Periodic-
Acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive goblet cells (Fig. 5f), PAS-positive
Paneth cells (Fig. 5g) and synaptophysin-positive enteroendocrine
cells (Fig. 5h) in the LacZ-stained clones. Using mutational marking,
ref. 2 reported the existence of different types of long-lived epithelial
clones; that is, columnar (enterocyte) clones, mucous (goblet) clones
and mixed clones. Our clones were exclusively of the mixed variety.
In blue clones, the frequency of goblet cells (114 of 2,043 total cells
counted), enterocytes (1,846 of 2,043) and Paneth cells (83 of 2,043)
was comparable to the frequency of goblet cells (127 of 3,691 total
cells counted), enterocytes (3,345 of 3,691) and Paneth cells (127 of
3,691) in unmarked adjacent epithelium. As noted2, the third secre-
tory cell type, the enteroendocrine cell, was too rare to allow accurate
enumeration. Taken together, we conclude that the Lgr51 CBC cells
represent the genuine stem cells of the small intestine.
Lgr51 cells are the stem cells of the colon
Analysis of the colon yielded essentially identical observations. The
Lgr51 cells yielded blue clones emanating from the crypt bottom
(Fig. 5i). These clones contained colonocytes as well as goblet cells,
and essentially remained unchanged during the 60 days of chase
(Fig. 5j, k). One important difference to the situation in the small
intestine involved the kinetics of clone formation. At 5 days, blue
staining in most crypts was still restricted to the bottom, and entirely
blue crypts were only rarely observed, implying that the colon stem
cells were more often quiescent than their small-intestinal counter-
parts. At later days, the relative number of entirely blue crypts
increased. Lgr51 colon cells fulfilled the stem-cell requirements in
being pluripotent and capable of maintaining epithelial self-renewal
over long periods of time.
Our observations provide the definitive characterization of the
intestinal stem cell by lineage tracing using the expression of a single
marker gene, Lgr5. The small intestinal Lgr51 cells are generally not
quiescent, but are rapidly cycling, as demonstrated by the expression
of Ki67 and phospho-histone H3, by the incorporation of BrdU and
by the kinetics of ribbon formation. Lgr51 cells of the small intestine
seem to divide more actively than their colonic counterparts, prob-
ably reflecting differences in the rate of epithelial turnover between
the two organs. It seems counterintuitive that stem cells cycle. This is,
however, not unprecedented. Germ stem cells in the Drosophila testis
and ovary, arguably the best understood adult stem cells in animals,
cycle throughout the lifetime of the adult fly18. Similarly, a recent
elegant study demonstrated that adult stem cells of mammalian skin
are continuously cycling19.
The cycling 14 cells have previously been proposed to represent
the small intestinal stem cells4, a notion not confirmed here. This
proposal was based on the observation that a DNA label incorporated
during periods of high stem-cell activity was specifically retained in
cells at the 14 position. Long-term label retention is often used as an
indirect strategy to identify stem cells12. It should be noted, however,
that terminally differentiating cells will also retain DNA labels, and
that label retention should therefore be interpreted with caution.
Previous studies have proposed other markers for intestinal stem
cells. Musashi20,21 and CD133 (ref. 22) in our hands stain up to 30–
50 cells per crypt (not shown), which seem to encompass CBC cells
as well as early transit-amplifying cells. Reference 23 described several
molecular markers for the 14 cells, including phospho-PTEN,
phospho-AKT and 14-3-3f. Our current study implies that the
validity of these putative stem-cell markers should be reconsidered.

Lgr5 may mark stem cells in other adult tissues
It seems rather unique that adult stem cells can be identified on the
basis of the expression of a single gene. This phenomenon may not be
restricted to the intestine, because we observe highly restricted Lgr5
expression in a variety of other tissues. Indeed, Lgr5 was recently
reported to be the second most highly upregulated gene as assessed
by differential expression arraying on isolated hair follicle stem
cells24. Moreover, preliminary lineage tracing experiments in the
hair follicle support the notion that Lgr51 cells represent stem cells
(N. Barker, H. Clevers and R. Toftgard, unpublished data). Whereas
patterns of proliferation in stomach glands have indicated that the
epithelial stem cells reside at the isthmus, halfway between the gland
base and epithelial surface25, we find Lgr5 expressed at gland bottoms
(Fig. 3f, g). Ongoing lineage tracing experiments imply that the entire
glands derive from these cells (N. Barker and H. Clevers, unpublished
data). In the mammary gland, stem cells reside in the basal epithelial
layer26, where we observe Lgr5 expression (not shown). Lgr5 may thus
represent a more general marker of adult stem cells. If true, the mouse
models developed in the course of this study will allow the isolation as
well as specific genetic modification of live adult stem cells in a variety
of organs. We first identified Lgr5 as a gene expressed in colon cancer
cells6. It is expressed in other cancers9,10 and, as described in the
current study, is also in scattered cells in pre-malignant mouse
adenomas. Future studies should explore the possibility that these
Lgr51 malignant cells may represent cancer stem cells.
METHODS SUMMARY
Northern blotting and induced Wnt pathway inhibition in LS174T clone L8.
This was performed as in ref. 6. Crypt and villus epithelial preparations for RNA
isolation were generated from 1–2-cm lengths of intestine by 8 rounds of incuba-
tion in a solution containing phosphate-buffered-saline lacking Ca21 and Mg21
(PBS0), 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA at 4 uC for 10 min, followed by vigorous
shaking. Fractions 3–4 and 7–8, comprising predominantly villi and crypts,
respectively, were used for RNA isolation.
Mice. Lgr5-lacZ mice were generated by homologous recombination in embry-
onic stem cells targeting an IRES-lacZ cassette to the 59 end of the last exon,
essentially removing all transmembrane regions (Lexicon). Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-
creERT2 mice were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem
cells targeting an EGFP-IRES-creERT2 cassette to the ATG of Lgr5. Rosa26-lacZ
Cre-reporter mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.
Tamoxifen induction. Mice of .8 weeks were injected intraperitoneally with
200 ml tamoxifen in sunflower oil at 10 mg ml21.
BrdU injection. Mice were injected intraperitoneally at 4-h intervals with 200 ml
BrdU solution in PBS at 5 mg ml21.
Tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and
LacZ analysis. This was performed as previously described27. In situ probes
comprising a 1 kb N-terminal fragment of mouse Lgr5 were generated from
Image Clone 30873333. Antibodies: Ki67 antibody (Monosan), phospho-
histone H3 (Campro Scientific), anti-synaptophysin (Dako) and anti-BrdU
(Roche). Polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP was supplied by E. Cuppen.
Immuno-electron microscopy. Intestines were dissected and perfuse-fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.2 M PHEM buffer (240 mM PIPES, 40 mM
EGTA, 100mM HEPES, 8 mM MgCl2 pH 6.9), embedded in gelatine, cryosec-
tioned with a Leica FCS cryoultratome and immunolabelled with polyclonal
rabbit anti-GFP antibody. Samples were trimmed using a diamond Cryotrim
90 knife at –100 uC (Diatome), and ultrathin sections of 70 nm were cut at –
120uC using a Cryoimmuno knife (Diatome). For the low-magnification
electron-microscope images, the 15-nm protein A-gold particles (UMCU) were
briefly silver-enhanced with R-GENT SE-EM (Aurion)28. Aspecific binding was
diminished by applying blocking solution (Aurion) before the primary antibody.

METHODS
Generation of Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice. The expression construct was
generated by cloning the various components into the polylinker of pBluescript
SK1 (Stratagene) as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 2. Lgr5 flanking arms were
generated by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction from 129S7-derived geno-
mic BAC clones. All components were sequence-verified. The expression con-
struct (100 mg) was linearized and transfected into male 129/Ola-derived IB10
embryonic stem cells (provided by The Netherlands Cancer Institute) by electro-
poration (800 V, 3 mF). Recombinant embryonic stem cell clones expressing the
neomycin gene were selected in medium supplemented with G418 (gentamycin
sulphate; the effective concentration of which was determined by its kill curve)
over a period of 7 days. Approximately 500 recombinant embryonic stem cell
clones were picked into duplicate 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured to
70% confluency. One plate was cryo-preserved and the other plate was used for
DNA isolation according to ref. 29. DNA from embryonic stem cells was
screened for the presence of homologous recombinants by Southern blotting
according to the strategy outlined in Supplementary Fig. 2. Positive clones were
thawed, expanded into 6-well tissue-culture plates and injected into C57BL/6
blastocysts using standard procedures. Male chimaeras born after transplanta-
tion of the bastocysts into C57BL/6 foster mothers were subsequently mated with
C57BL/6 females, and germline transmission was confirmed by screening off-
spring for the presence of the expression cassette in the Lgr5 locus by polymerase
chain reaction. The neomycin expression cassette was then excised in vivo by
crossing the mice with EIIa-Cre mice as previously described30.
b-galactosidase (LacZ) staining protocol. Organs were isolated and immedi-
ately incubated for 2 h in a 20-fold volume of ice-cold fixative (1% formalde-
hyde, 0.2% gluteraldehyde and 0.02% NP40 in PBS0) at 4 uC on a rolling
platform. Intestines, colon and stomach were first cleaned by flushing with
fixative to remove faeces and undigested food. The fixative was removed and
the tissues washed twice in PBS0 for 20 min at room temperature (20 uC) on a
rolling platform. The b-galactosidase substrate (5 mM K3FE(CN)6, 5 mM
K4Fe(CN)6?3H2O, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NP40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and
1 mg ml–1 X-gal in PBS0) was then added and the tissues incubated in the dark
overnight at room temperature. The substrate was removed and the tissues
washed twice in PBS0 for 20 min at room temperature on a rolling platform.
The tissues were then fixed overnight in a 20-fold volume of 4% PFA in PBS0 at
4 uC in the dark on a rolling platform. The PFA was removed and the tissues
washed twice in PBS0 for 20 min at room temperature on a rolling platform.
The stained tissues were transferred to tissue cassettes and paraffin blocks
prepared using standard methods. Tissue sections (4 mM) were prepared and
counterstained with neutral red.
Whole-mount analysis of LacZ staining as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 was
performed on 150-mM tissue sections prepared on a vibratome (HM650V,
Microm).
Confocal analysis of EGFP expression. 150-mm sections were prepared from
non-fixed intestines using a vibratome and were fixed for 5 min in 4% form-
aldehyde. After counterstaining with ToPro-3 (Molecular Probes) the sections
were analysed for EGFP expression by confocal microscopy (Leica SP2 AOBS).
The observed emission spectrum was compared with reference spectra to con-
firm that the observed fluorescence was EGFP-derived.
In situ hybridization protocol. The in situ probes used in this study correspond
to expressed sequence tags obtained from the IMAGE consortium (Geneservice
Ltd; ImaGenes GmbH). The GenBank accession and IMAGE numbers for these
probes are as follow: mouse Lgr5, CN70148, IMAGE 30873333; Cryptdin-1,
AA871421, IMAGE 1096215; and KIAA0007, BF158985, IMAGE 3982366. To
ensure the specificity of the probes, we generated both sense and antisense probes
by in vitro transcription using DIG RNA labelling mix (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Intestines from normal or ApcMin mice were flushed and fixed overnight in
formalin. Samples were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at
8 mM and processed for hybridization as described below. Sections were de-
waxed, re-hydrated, treated with 0.2 M HCl, digested in proteinase K solution,
post-fixed, treated in acetic anhydride solution and hybridized overnight for 24–
48 h at 68 uC with various probes in 53 SSC (pH 4.5), 50% formamide, 2%
blocking powder (Roche), 5 mM EDTA, 50 mg ml21 yeast transfer RNA, 0.1%
Tween 20, 0.05% CHAPS and 50 mg ml21 heparin. Sections were then rinsed in
23 SSC and washed for 3 3 20 min at either 60 uC or 65 uC in 23 SSC per 50%
formamide. After several rinses in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween
(TBST), sections were then blocked for 30 min in TBST containing 0.5% block-
ing powder (Roche). Sections were subsequently incubated in blocking solution
overnight at 4 uC with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin
(1/2,000 dilution, Roche). After washing several times in TBST, the colour reac-
tion was performed with NBT/BCIP solution. For image analysis, sections were
temporally mounted in glycerol or permanently mounted after dehydration in
Pertex.
Isolation of intestinal crypt and villus fractions. Intestines were washed in ice-
cold PBS (Mg21/Ca21) and sliced longitudinally to expose the crypts and villi.
The intestine was then cut into small pieces (1–2-cm long) and washed several
times in ice-cold PBS (Mg21/Ca21) to remove contaminants such as faeces and
hair. The intestine pieces were incubated in a solution containing PBS0 (lacking
Mg21/Ca21), 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA at 4 uC for 10 min on a rotating
platform. The PBS0, containing loose pieces of mesenchyme and intestine, was
decanted, cold PBS0 was added, and the tube was shaken vigorously ten times.
The cells shed into the PBS0 were collected and labelled as fraction 1. The
intestine pieces were again incubated in solution containing fresh PBS0, 1 mM
EDTA and 1 mM EGTA at 4 uC for 10 min on a rotating platform. The PBS0 was
decanted, fresh PBS0 was added and the tube was shaken vigorously 10–15 times.
The cells shed into the PBS0 were filtered through a 70 mM nylon cell strainer(BD
Falcon) and the flow-through discarded. The tissue retained on the filter, com-
prising villi, was stored in PBS (Mg21/Ca21) on ice (fraction 2). The incubation,
shaking and straining steps were repeated until eight fractions had been col-
lected. Fractions 3–6 comprised pure villus tissue, whereas fractions 7 and 8
isolated as the flow-through from the cell strainer comprised pure crypt tissue.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the mouse intestinal epithelium,
Lgr5þ stem cells are vulnerable to injury, owing to their
predominantly
cycling
nature,
and
their
progenies
de-
differentiate to replenish the stem cell pool. However, how
human colonic stem cells behave in homeostasis and during
regeneration remains unknown. METHODS: Transcriptional
heterogeneity among colonic epithelial cells was analyzed by
means of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human and
mouse colonic epithelial cells. To trace the fate of human
colonic stem or differentiated cells, we generated LGR5-
tdTomato,
LGR5-iCasase9-tdTomato,
LGR5-split-Cre,
and
KRT20-ERCreER knock-in human colon organoids via genome
engineering. p27þ dormant cells were further visualized with
the p27-mVenus reporter. To analyze the dynamics of human
colonic stem cells in vivo, we orthotopically xenotransplanted
ﬂuorescence-labeled human colon organoids into immune-
deﬁcient mice. The cell cycle dynamics in xenograft cells
were evaluated using 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine pulse-chase
analysis. The clonogenic capacity of slow-cycling human stem
cells or differentiated cells was analyzed in the context of
homeostasis,
LGR5
ablation,
and
5-ﬂuorouracil–induced
mucosal injury. RESULTS: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
illuminated the presence of nondividing LGR5þ stem cells in
the human colon. Visualization and lineage tracing of slow-
cycling LGR5þp27þ cells and orthotopic xenotransplantation
validated their homeostatic lineage-forming capability in vivo,
which was augmented by 5-FU–induced mucosal damage.
Transforming growth factor–b signaling regulated the quies-
cent state of LGR5þ cells. Despite the plasticity of differenti-
ated KRT20þ cells, they did not display clonal growth after
5-FU–induced injury, suggesting that occupation of the niche
environment
by
LGR5þp27þ
cells
prevented
neighboring
differentiated cells from de-differentiating. CONCLUSIONS:
Our results highlight the quiescent nature of human LGR5þ
colonic
stem
cells and
their contribution
to post-injury
regeneration.

T
issue stem cells are deﬁned as cells with long-term
self-renewal and multidifferentiation capacities.1
Cellular quiescence or dormancy, albeit not included in
this deﬁnition, has long been considered as another hall-
mark of tissue stem cells.2 Quiescence is a reversible
nondividing G0 state, characterized by minimal energy
consumption, low RNA content, and reduced protein syn-
thesis. These characteristics are known to prevent he-
matopoietic
and
muscle
stem
cells
from
premature
exhaustion.3 The quiescent cells were identiﬁed in the
mouse intestinal epithelium at the fourth cellular position
from the crypt base using label-retaining assay, hence
referred to as “label-retaining cells” (LRCs) or þ4 cells.4
However, whether LRCs have stemness has been contro-
versial for decades. Recent development of genetic lineage
tracing systems has reconciled this issue by demonstrating
that cycling Lgr5þ cells, rather than LRCs, behave as intes-
tinal stem cells (ISCs) in homeostasis.5 LRCs commit to
differentiation, yet can revert to ISCs only after depletion of
pre-existing ISCs by injury.6–12 Although mouse genetic
models have provided clear-cut evidence for the cell cycle
state of ISCs, whether this framework applies to human ISCs
has been obscure due to the lack of experimental systems.
Organoid technology has emerged as a key experimental
tool to assess the functionality of human ISCs.13 We recently
established an orthotopic xenotransplantation technique
that engrafts human colon organoids onto the surface of
epithelium-removed mouse colon. A combination of ortho-
topic xenotransplantation and genetic lineage tracing vali-
dated the existence and functionality of human colonic stem
cells (hCoSCs) in a tissue context.14 Contrary to Lgr5þ cells
in the surrounding mouse tissue, most human LGR5þ cells
were Ki67-negative, suggesting that hCoSCs are slowly
cycling. The expression of Ki67, however, provides only
snapshot information on cell cycle states, and it remains
unclear whether the low Ki67 positivity among hCoSCs re-
ﬂects the G1 transition of cycling cells or cell-intrinsic
quiescence. To address these questions, we obtained a
panorama of human colonic epithelial cells using single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identiﬁed a nondividing
subpopulation in human LGR5þ colonic cells. By leveraging
genetic lineage tracing and orthotopic xenotransplantation,
we demonstrated the stemness of slow-cycling human
LGR5þ cells in homeostasis and during regeneration. Our
ﬁndings not only highlight the difference in ISC biology
between mice and humans, but they also lay a foundation
for future research that aspires to control or facilitate
regenerative response in the human gut.
Methods
Human Tissues
A healthy human colon sample for scRNA-seq was obtained
from the resected specimen of a 78-year-old woman with
ascending colon cancer. The tissue was sampled from the
normal mucosa 10 cm from the tumor. Normal colonic orga-
noids were established previously from the ascending colon of
a 68-year-old woman and from the descending colon of a 68-
year-old man.14 All procedures were approved by the ethics
committees at Keio University Hospital and Tokyo University
Hospital.
Mice
All animal procedures were approved by the Keio Univer-
sity School of Medicine Animal Care Committee. Male NOD/Shi-
scid, IL-2Rgnull mice (5–6 weeks old) and C57BL/6 mice were
obtained from the Central Institute for Experimental Animals
(Kawasaki, Japan). Orthotopic xenotransplantation of human
colonic organoids was performed as described previously.14 We
obtained mouse colonic crypts from 3 female 12-week-old
C57BL/6 mice for scRNA-seq using the same procedures for
human crypt isolation.
Culture and Gene Engineering of Organoids
We cultured human colonic organoids as described previ-
ously.15 We generated LGR5-iCasase9-tdTomato (LGR5-iCT),
LGR5-CreER,
LGR5-split-Cre,
and
KRT20-ERCreER
knock-in
organoids. The split-Cre system was designed as reported
previously.8 For visualization of p27, the p27-mVenus reporter
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Mouse Lgr5þ stem cells are cycling rapidly and injury-
sensitive. However, the dynamic behavior of human
colonic
stem
cells
in
homeostasis
and
during
regeneration remains unclear.
NEW FINDINGS
Combination
of
organoids,
genome
editing,
and
transplantation technologies demonstrated that human
LGR5þp27þ cells are slow-cycling colon stem cells.
LGR5þp27þ cells are resistant to injury and fuel mucosal
regeneration after chemotherapy.
LIMITATIONS
Given our small cohort size, whether the cell cycle
duration
of
LGR5þp27þ
cells
is
affected
by
the
individual’s background, such as sex, age, and ethnicity,
remains uncertain.
IMPACT
By harmonizing organoid technology with genome editing
and
orthotopic
transplantation,
we
were
able
to
investigate the functional dynamics of human colonic
stem cells in a near-native tissue context.

(a gift from T. Kitamura, Tokyo University)16 was introduced
into the human colonic organoids. Mouse colonic organoids
were established from 12-week-old Lgr5-DTR-EGFP male mice
(a gift from F. J. de Sauvage). Additional details are described in
the Supplementary Methods.
Results
Single-Cell Characterization of Human Colonic
Stem Cells
To survey the transcriptomes of human colonic epithelial
cells, we conducted an scRNA-seq analysis of the human
colonic epithelium. Unsupervised clustering partitioned
human colonic epithelial cells into 10 subpopulations, of
which 5 subpopulations represented differentiated cell
subtypes based on the gene expression proﬁle, including
colonocyte-1, colonocyte-2, goblet cell-1, goblet cell-2, and
BEST4/OTOP2
cell17,18
(Figure
1A,
Supplementary
Figure 1A). Among the other 5 immature subpopulations
was an LGR5þ stem cell subpopulation characterized by the
distinct expression of stem cell markers LGR5, ASCL2, and
SMOC2 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A). A secretory
progenitor subpopulation expressed its known markers,
including NEUROG3, HES6, PROX1, SOX4, and the prolifera-
tion marker STMN1 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A
and B). This subpopulation also exhibited high levels of LRC
and Mex3a signatures,7,8 reminiscent of þ4 cells in the
mouse
small
intestine
(Figure
1B,
Supplementary
Figure 1B). The other 3 immature populations were
considered to be transit amplifying cells, based on their low
expression level of differentiation markers and enrichment
of cell cycle markers (Figure 1B). A re-analysis of 2 public
scRNA-seq datasets validated our results (Supplementary
Figure 1C).17,18
The LGR5þ stem cell subpopulation displayed low
expression levels of proliferation markers MKI67, CCNB1,
and PCNA (Figure 1B), which contrasted with the predom-
inantly proliferative mouse Lgr5þ stem cells. To compare
the cycling status between mouse and human CoSCs, we
performed scRNA-seq of the mouse colonic epithelium and
also retrieved public scRNA-seq data of the mouse co-
lon.19,20 A combined analysis of mouse and human colon
scRNA-seq
data
revealed
9
shared
subpopulations
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 2A and B). As described
previously,21 BEST4þ cells were absent from the mouse
colon. Expression of ISC marker genes distinguished CoSCs
in the combined analysis (Figure 1C). The expression of cell
cycle genes revealed that most hCoSCs were nondividing,
whereas the mouse CoSCs comprised cells in S and G2/M
phases (Figure 1D).
To validate the scRNA-seq results, we analyzed sections
of colon tissues. LGR5 mRNA in situ hybridization and Ki67
immunohistochemistry conﬁrmed the rarity of human Ki67-
expressing LGR5þ cells (Figure 1E). Ki67 staining of the
Lgr5GFP mouse colon validated the proliferative property of
mouse colon Lgr5þ cells (Figure 1F). Human Ki67–LGR5þ
cells were localized mainly at the crypt bottom, with an
inverse topological arrangement compared with mouse
Ki67–Lgr5þ cells (Figure 1E and F). These results collec-
tively highlighted the unique cycling status and localization
pattern of LGR5þ hCoSCs.
Identiﬁcation of Human LGR5þp27þ Slow-
Cycling Stem Cells
Although scRNA-seq illuminated the presence of nondi-
viding LGR5þ cells in the human colon, their isolation and
functional assessment require identiﬁcation of their positive
markers. With this aim, we referred to the gene expression
proﬁle of human colonic organoids and nominated cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitors, p21, p27, and p57, as poten-
tial markers for nondividing cells. These cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors were selectively expressed in Ki67-
negative cells, but the speciﬁcity for LGR5þ cells differed
among the markers. p21 and p57 were scarcely expressed
in the lower crypt, whereas p27 marked virtually all Ki67–
cells at the crypt bottom. As LGR5 in situ hybridization and
p27 immunostaining were technically incompatible, we
conﬁrmed the overlap of p27 and LGR5 expressions using
serial section analysis (Figure 2A). p27 was also expressed
in upper-crypt Ki67– cells, suggesting p27 as a pan-
nondividing cell marker in the human colonic epithelium.
Although p27 was also expressed in a minority of Ki67– cells
in mouse colonic crypts (Supplementary Figure 3A), only a
mean ± SEM of 0.71 ± 0.16 Lgr5þp27þ cells were found per
crypt, in agreement with the cycling status of mouse Lgr5þ
CoSCs.5,22
We next sought to ﬂuorescently label p27þ cells for
further characterization of human colon LGR5þp27þ cells.
As the expression level of p27 is regulated by means of
ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, we employed a p27
reporter, in which mVenus is fused to mutant-p27 with no
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory activity16 (Figure 2B).
The p27-mVenus fusion protein is degraded in parallel with
endogenous p27 by the proteasome machinery,23 and its
emission thereby mirrors the endogenous p27 expression.
For simultaneous visualization of p27 and LGR5, we intro-
duced p27-mVenus and LGR5-tdTomato reporters into hu-
man colonic organoids (Figure 2B). Mutually exclusive
expression of p27-mVenus and Ki67 was conﬁrmed in re-
porter organoids (Figure 2C). Overexpression of p27-
mVenus minimally affected the proportion of Ki67þ cells
in LGR5þ cells and organoid growth, excluding its growth-
inhibitory
effect
on
human
colonic
organoids
(Supplementary Figure 3B–E).
To determine the self-renewal potential of LGR5þp27þ
cells, we next performed a colony-formation assay. Sorted
LGR5þp27þ cells efﬁciently formed organoids, albeit with
reduced
competence
compared
with
LGR5þp27–
cells
(Figure 2D–F). A similar result was obtained from another
LGR5-tdTomato/p27-mVenus reporter line derived from an
independent donor (Figure 2E and F). Double staining of
Pyronin Y and Hoechst 33342 revealed that 83% and 43%
of sorted LGR5þp27þ and LGR5þp27– cells were in the G0
phase, respectively, indicating efﬁcient detection of the
nonproliferative status by the p27 reporter (Figure 2G). To
further delineate the dynamics of LGR5þp27þ cells, we

performed single-cell resolution live imaging of reporter
colon organoids. LGR5þp27þ cells rarely divided and
maintained stable p27 and LGR5 expression during a 64-
hour observation (Figure 2H). Approximately 10% of
LGR5þp27þ cells became LGR5þp27– cells and proliferated
subsequently, indicating the reversibility of the G0 state in
LGR5þp27þ
cells.
In
contrast
to
LGR5þp27þ
cells,
LGR5þp27– cells were expanding rapidly. Approximately
one-half of the LGR5þp27– cells eventually produced at least
1 LGR5þp27þ cell, whereas the remaining one-half lost
LGR5 expression, presumably due to differentiation. These
results suggested that LGR5þp27– cells are more prone to
differentiation than LGR5þp27þ cells in in vitro organoid
culture (Supplementary Figure 3F).
Lack of Lgr5þp27þ Slow-Cycling Stem Cells in
the Mouse Colon Epithelium
To compare the cell cycle behavior of CoSCs between
humans and mice, we introduced the p27-mVenus reporter
into Lgr5-GFP mouse colon organoids. Consistent with the
expression pattern in the native tissue (Supplementary
Figure 3A), Ki67– cells in mouse colon organoids sporadi-
cally
displayed
dim
p27-mVenus
reporter
expression
(Supplementary Figure 3G and H). Live imaging revealed
that more than one-half of Lgr5þp27þ cells lost p27-mVenus
expression within 1 day (Supplementary Figure 3I). Given
the evanescent p27 reporter expression during early G1/late
G1 transition in a previous report,16 the p27 expression in
mouse Lgr5þ cells is likely to reﬂect their early G1 state
rather than G0 status. Together, human and mouse colon
LGR5þ cells showed distinct cell cycle behaviors in an
identical culture environment.
Human Colon LGR5þp27þ Cells Behave as
Label-Retaining Cells in a Tissue Context
To investigate the dynamics of LGR5þ hCoSCs in vivo, we
generated orthotopic intraluminal xenografts of human co-
lon organoids, as described previously.14 Brieﬂy, we de-
tached the native epithelium from the distal colon of
immune-deﬁcient mice using EDTA, and replaced the
epithelium with human colonic organoids by infusing the
organoids through the anus. After stable implantation, we
performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA-seq analyses
of the original organoids, LGR5-tdTomato/p27-mVenus re-
porter
organoids
and
xenograft-derived
organoids
to
exclude possible accrual and enrichment of speciﬁc genomic
abnormalities
during
gene
engineering
and
xeno-
transplantation procedures. These analyses indicated the
similarity of transcriptome proﬁles and the lack of con-
spicuous copy-number alterations among the samples
(Supplementary Figure 4A and B).
After
being
xenotransplanted
onto
the
epithelium-
denuded mouse colon, LGR5þp27þ cells were positioned
at the crypt bottom, mirroring their localization in the hu-
man colon (Figure 3A). To determine the cycling behavior of
LGR5þp27þ cells, we administered 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyur-
idine (EdU) to xenograft-bearing mice. Upon a 1-hour
treatment, EdU marked the cells in the proliferating zone,
while sparing the crypt bottom (Supplementary Figure 5A
and B). This incorporation pattern was compatible with
previous
in
vivo
human
studies
using
3H-thymidine
administration.24,25 A continuous 1-day and 4-day EdU
treatment labeled virtually all LGR5þ cells above the þ4
position and approximately 17% and 60% of LGR5þ cells at
the crypt bottom, respectively. Based on these EdU incor-
poration rates, the duration of cell cycle in LGR5þ cells
residing above the þ4 position or at the crypt bottom was
estimated to be 1.5 days or 7.3 days, respectively. After a
14-day or 21-day EdU washout (Supplementary Figure 5A
and C), LRCs were observed in a mean ± SEM of 20.1% ±
2.6% (14 days) or 5.6% ± 0.7% (21 days) of LGR5þ cells in
xenografts, but were absent from the surrounding mouse
colon epithelium (Supplementary Figure 5C–E), consistent
with previous reports.26,27 However, more than one-half of
LRCs expressed LGR5 (Supplementary Figure 5F). The
remaining
LGR5-negative
LRCs
were
mostly
enter-
oendocrine cells (Supplementary Figure 5G). We then
orthotopically
xenotransplanted
LGR5-tdTomato/p27-
mVenus
organoids
and
conﬁrmed
that
most
of
the
LGR5þLRCs co-expressed the p27 reporter (Figure 3B and
C). These results indicate the existence of LRCs in the human
colon, as well as the ﬁdelity of the p27-mVenus reporter in
the xenograft model.
Transforming Growth Factor–b Signaling
Regulates the Dormancy of Human Colonic Stem
Cells
We next sought to determine the mechanism that regu-
lates the p27þ state in hCoSCs. During the culture of orga-
noids, we fortuitously found that removal of a transforming
growth factor–b (TGF-b) inhibitor markedly increases the

sensitivity between the 2 species (Figure 3F and G).
Therefore, the quiescent state of hCoSCs may reﬂect their
relatively higher sensitivity to TGF-b.
We next analyzed TGF-b activation status in patient co-
lon tissues using immunohistochemistry. SMAD3 phos-
phorylation, which indicates active TGF-b signaling, was
evident at the colonic epithelium surface (Figure 3H and I).
After signal enhancement, we detected phospho-SMAD3 in
Ki67– cells at the crypt bottom (Figure 3I). The speciﬁcity of
phospho-SMAD3
staining
was
validated
using
TGF-b
inhibitor–treated
and
TGF-b–treated
organoids
(Supplementary
Figure
5J).
Consistently,
we
detected
SMAD3 phosphorylation in the crypt bottom cells of ortho-
topic xenografts, but not in those of the surrounding mouse
epithelium (Figure 3H). Re-analysis of a public scRNA-seq
dataset of the human colon revealed mRNA expression of
TGFb1 predominantly in endothelial cells, implying their
role
as
a
TGF-b
ligand
supplier
(Supplementary
Figure 5K).18 These results suggest that the quiescent sta-
tus and p27 expression in human colonic crypt base cells
are regulated by means of TGF-b signaling.
To further determine the role of TGF-b signaling in the
dormancy maintenance, we performed CRISPR-Cas9–medi-
ated knockout of TGFbR2, an essential receptor component
of TGF-b signaling. Legitimate TGFbR2 knockout was
conﬁrmed by means of Sanger sequencing and resistance to
TGF-b
treatment
(Supplementary
Figure
6A).
TGFbR2
knockout organoids did not show SMAD2/3 phosphoryla-
tion after TGF-b treatment, indicating complete inactivation
of TGF-b signaling (Supplementary Figure 6B). In contrast to
the enrichment of LGR5þp27þ cells in TGF-b–treated con-
trol organoids, TGF-b treatment failed to increase the
number of LGR5þp27þ cells in TGFbR2-knockout organoids
(Supplementary Figure 6C–E). We further determined the
functional effect of TGF-b signal inhibition using xenograft
models.
TGFbR2-knockout
xenografts
were
devoid
of
SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 6F), and
showed fewer LGR5þp27þ cells and a higher EdU incorpo-
ration rate in LGR5þ cells compared with control organoid
xenografts (Supplementary Figure 6G–I). These results
collectively demonstrate the role of TGF-b signaling in the
maintenance of slow-cycling LGR5þ cells in the human
colonic epithelium.
LGR5þ Human Colonic Stem Cells Persist During
Chemotherapy
We next explored the functional role of slow-cycling
LGR5þ cells in the human colon epithelium using a
chemotherapy-induced
injury
model.
To
prospectively
analyze whether LGR5þp27þ cells are chemoresistant, we
generated LGR5-CreER/LGR5-tdTomato double knock-in
human colonic organoids and subsequently introduced the
p27-mVenus reporter and the Cre-activatable iRFP-BFP re-
porter (Supplementary Figure 7A). In vitro live imaging of
these organoids allowed us to dynamically capture clonal
lineage generation from single LGR5þ cells, together with
information on p27 expression (Supplementary Figure 7B).
In a standard culture condition, LGR5þp27þ cells minimally
divided and remained p27þ during the 4-day observation
period (Supplementary Figure 7C), whereas LGR5þp27–
cells
vigorously
propagated
yet
rarely
generated
LGR5þp27þ cells (Supplementary Figure 7C). An exposure
to 5-FU stalled the proliferation of LGR5þp27– cells and
their lineage formation (Supplementary Figure 7D). Inter-
estingly, LGR5þp27þ cells tolerated 5-FU and underwent
cell cycle re-entry, as indicated by the loss of p27 expression
(Supplementary
Figure
7D).
Thus,
LGR5þp27þ
cells
contribute to clonal lineage formation in a steady state, but
are mobilized after injury in vitro.
To validate the chemoresistance of LGR5þ cells in a
tissue context, we administered a sublethal dose of 5-FU to
mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of LGR5-tdTomato/p27-
mVenus organoids. The cytotoxic effect of 5-FU was
conﬁrmed by the loss of Ki67 expression in the recipient
mouse and donor human epithelia (Figure 4A). Consistent
with previous reports,6,11,29,30 5-FU treatment eradicated
murine Lgr5þ CoSCs (Figure 4B). In contrast, LGR5þ hCoSCs
remained in xenografts, indicating CoSCs in mice and
humans
respond
differentially
to
cytotoxic
damage
(Figure 4B). In agreement with the eradication of cycling
cells, 5-FU treatment enriched p27þ cells in LGR5þ cells of

xenografts (Figure 4C and D). The proportion of Ki67þ cells
in LGR5þ cells increased sharply 10 days after 5-FU treat-
ment, which suggests that LGR5þKi67– cells re-entered the
cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 7E–G). Of note, nuclear
YAP expression, a hallmark of the regenerative response in
the intestine,31,32 was not evident in stable xenografts of
human colon organoids. 5-FU treatment triggered YAP
activation
in
parallel
with
the
cell-cycle
re-entry
(Supplementary Figure 7G and H). These results indicate
that a common mechanism of YAP activation operates post-
injury regeneration of the human colon epithelium.
The presence of human LGR5þ cells after chemo-injury
suggests the persistence of pre-existing LGR5þ cells. How-
ever, an alternative scenario is that the original LGR5þ cells
were lost by means of 5-FU treatment, and LGR5þ cells were
newly generated from LGR5– cells. To address this possi-
bility, we analyzed clone formation from pre-existing LGR5þ
cells in 5-FU–treated xenografts. Previously, we described
LGR5-CreER/rainbow reporter human colonic organoids
that ubiquitously express nuclear GFP and convert their
color into either RFP, CFP, or YFP upon tamoxifen treat-
ment.14 In this system, tamoxifen treatment induced re-
porter switching, speciﬁcally in LGR5þ cells of LGR5-CreER/
rainbow organoid xenografts (Figure 4E). 5-FU treatment
after tamoxifen administration did not abolish clonal lineage
formation from LGR5þ cells, indicating that pre-existing
LGR5þ
cells
maintained
self-renewal
capacity
during
chemotherapy (Figure 4F). Clonal ribbon structures also
contained differentiated cell types together with crypt bot-
tom LGR5þ cells (Figure 4G). These results suggested that
LGR5þ hCoSCs persisted during 5-FU treatment and sub-
sequently generated multilineage progenies, indicative of
their stemness.
LGR5þp27þ Cells Manifest Stemness in
Homeostasis and After Injury in Vivo
Although the above lineage tracing suggests the persis-
tence of LGR5þ cells during chemo-injury, the low spatio-
temporal resolution left it ambiguous whether the clonal
ribbon formation was derived from slow-cycling LGR5þ
cells or p27–LGR5þ cells. To more speciﬁcally determine the
origin of the lineage formation, we sought to trace the
descendants of cells that express both LGR5 and p27 using a
split-Cre system8 (Figure 5A). We ﬁrst knocked-in the C-
terminal domain of Cre (CreC) into the intact LGR5 allele of
LGR5-tdTomato organoids (Supplementary Figure 8A and
B).
We
then
introduced

p27-N-terminal
domain of Cre (CreN) into LGR5-tdTomato/LGR5-CreC
organoids, in which CreN is constantly degraded by pro-
teasome in cycling cells. Each of CreC and CreN was linked
with FKBP, such that they fuse together and form the full-
form
Cre
protein
by
means
of
dimerizer
treatment
(Figure 5A). Thus, in this system, functional Cre protein is
expressed only when LGR5 is transcribed and p27 is un-
degraded. As a Cre-activatable reporter, we lastly intro-
duced the nGFP-BFP reporter. The resulting organoids
ubiquitously expressed nGFP and gave rise to BFPþ cells
after a treatment with dimerizer/doxycycline (Figure 5A).
Ki67 immunostaining conﬁrmed that BFP-traced cells were
nondividing (Supplementary Figure 8C). Consistent with the
prior result (Supplementary Figure 7D), in vitro live imaging
demonstrated that LGR5þp27þ (BFP-traced) clones per-
sisted during 5-FU treatment and formed ribbons after a 5-
FU washout (Supplementary Figure 8D and E). These results
indicated the speciﬁcity and ﬁdelity of the LGR5-p27 split-
Cre system in vitro.
We next investigated the in vivo clonal behavior of
LGR5þp27þ cells using orthotopic xenografts of LGR5-p27
split-Cre organoids (Figure 5B). Most BFP-traced cells were
recognized as single cells shortly after administration of
dimerizer/doxycycline, and were devoid of Ki67 expression
(Figure 5C). One month after tracing, BFPþ clones formed
small clusters consisting of 3–5 descendants (Figure 5D and
E). Even 3 months after the tracing, LGR5þp27þ cells gave
rise to only scattered BFPþ clones, whereas a corresponding
time frame was sufﬁcient to render mouse colon crypts
monoclonal.6 Of note, we observed 3 major differentiated
cell types (ie, colonocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine
cells) in BFPþ clones, indicative of the multipotency of
LGR5þp27þ cells (Supplementary Figure 8F). A single short-
term EdU labeling 1 month after BFP tracing further
depicted generation of cycling LGR5þp27–EdUþ offspring
from LGR5þp27þ cells (Supplementary Figure 8G).
We ﬁnally determined whether 5-FU treatment affects
the clonal dynamics of LGR5þp27þ cells. Xenograft-bearing

mice received dimerizer/doxycyclin treatment and were

speciﬁc lineage tracing from pre-existing LGR5þp27þ cells

suggests the re-acquisition of the proliferative competence
after injury. The number of LGR5þ cells within the traced
BFPþ clones also increased after chemotherapy (Figure 5G).
These data indicate that LGR5þ cells serve as a driver of
post-injury regeneration.
Persistence of LGR5þp27þ Cells Prevents
Reversion of KRT20þ Cells
Mounting data have supported the model whereby
mouse intestinal Lgr5þ cells are susceptible to injury and
differentiated cells subsequently undergo reversion to
replenish lost stem cells.6,11,29,30,33 Although our data
demonstrate a differing mode of post-injury regeneration in
the human intestinal epithelium that emanates from LGR5þ
cells, it does not exclude the potential contribution of
differentiated cells to regeneration. To explore this possi-
bility, we generated LGR5-iCT organoids in which a dimer-
izer treatment induces apoptosis speciﬁcally in LGR5þ cells
(Figure 6A and B, Supplementary Figure 9A). In LGR5-iCT
xenografts, expressions of LGR5-tdTomato and the differ-
entiation
marker
KRT20
were
mutually
exclusive
(Figure 6C). A treatment with dimerizer efﬁciently eradi-
cated LGR5þ cells, but the engrafts persisted after the
ablation (Figure 6C, Supplementary Figure 9B–D). Consis-
tently, proliferating cells were intact during the ablation
(Supplementary Figure 9E) and LGR5þ cells reappeared by
day 15 after the dimerizer treatment (Figure 6C). These
results suggest that LGR5-ablated epithelium reserved a
proliferating population that could repopulate the crypt
bottom.
To determine whether reversion is implicated in post-
injury regeneration, we sought to trace non-LGR5þ cells
using a KRT20-reporter. We introduced KRT20-ERCreER
and a Cre-activatable nGFP-BFP reporter into LGR5-iCT
organoids (Supplementary Figure 9F and G) and subse-
quently generated their orthotopic xenografts. Tamoxifen
treatment induced expression of the BFP reporter specif-
ically
in
KRT20-expressing
cells
in
the
xenografts
(Supplementary Figure 9H). Lineage tracing revealed that
the KRT20-lineage diminished over time, conﬁrming their
differentiated nature in homeostasis (Figure 6F). Ablation
of LGR5þ cells by dimerizer treatment allowed KRT20þ
cells to give rise to LGR5þ cells and form clonal ribbon
structures, indicative of their de-differentiation capacity
(Figure 6G and H). In contrast, lineage formation was not
evident after 5-FU treatment, demonstrating the scarcity of
reversion events (Figure 6G and H). As shown previously,
LGR5þ cells persisted at the crypt bottom during 5-FU, and
the crypt bottom niche could not be accessed in this situ-
ation. Therefore, direct contact with the niche environment
may be a prerequisite for KRT20þ cells to undergo de-
differentiation.
Discussion
We
integrated
organoid
technology,
CRISPR-Cas9–
mediated
genetic
knock-in,
and
orthotopic
xeno-
transplantation to conduct an in-depth functional analysis of
LGR5þ hCoSCs. By resolving the spatiotemporal restriction
of conventional assays, we demonstrated the stemness of
slow-cycling LGR5þ cells in the human colonic epithelium.
Slow-cycling LGR5þ CoSCs constitute up to 70% of the
LGR5þ population in the human colon. An analysis of the
EdU incorporation rate in xenografts estimated the cell cycle
duration of LGR5þp27þ stem cells to be 7.3 days. This
ﬁnding is consistent with identiﬁcation of LRCs at the hu-
man colon crypt bottom using 3H-thymidine pulse chase in
the 1960s.24,34 Possibly reﬂecting this dormant state,
LGR5þp27þ stem cells generated small clones in 1-month
tracing. Each LGR5þ cell-derived clone contained 1.17
LGR5þp27þ cells, on average (Figure 5G), suggesting that
although LGR5þp27þ cells gave rise to daughter cells in 1
week, only 1 of them could occupy the human crypt stem
cell niche throughout the 1-month period. Stated alterna-
tively, LGR5þp27þ cells rarely gain or lose the stem cell
niche. Our results are consistent with the extremely low
stem cell replacement rate of 0.65–2.7/year in the human
colon, which was estimated by means of spontaneous so-
matic mutation-based tracing.35 Given the relatively short
lifespan of immune-deﬁcient mice, it is challenging to
accurately estimate stem cell replacement using xenograft
models. Our study also used male mice only, due to the
breeder’s regulation, and whether the sex of recipient mice
affects the cell cycle speed of CoSCs remains unclear.
Nevertheless, our results consistently pointed to the sub-
stantive difference in stem cell behavior between human
and mouse colons.
Inspired by the fact that human colon organoids, but not
mouse colon organoids, require TGF-b inhibitor for long-
term culture, we explored whether TGF-b signaling con-
tributes to the quiescent state of hCoSCs. An exposure to

low-dose TGF-b1 terminated proliferation in human colon
organoids but not in mouse organoids. As both human and
mouse colon epithelia express TGFbR components, differing
regulation downstream of TGFbR may underlie distinct
TGF-b sensitivities. A combination of CRISPR-Cas9 and
orthotopic xenograft further revealed the increased number
of cycling LGR5þ cells in the TGFbR2-knockout human colon
epithelium. These results demonstrated that TGF-b acti-
vating microenvironments are operative in the mouse colon,
and that epithelium-autonomous TGF-b response controls
the cell cycle speed of CoSCs. Although the source of func-
tional TGF-b ligands in the colon remains elusive, re-
analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed the expression of
TGFb1 in colonic endothelial cells. The observation that a
few LGR5þp27þ cells remained in the TGFbR2 knockout
colon epithelium also suggests a contribution of other
pathways in the cell-cycle regulation of CoSCs.
Our ﬁndings recall a long-standing question regarding
the species difference, that is, why do human CoSCs exhibit
slower cell cycle than mouse counterparts? As the cell di-
vision event per se triggers replication errors and tumori-
genesis, it is tempting to associate the cell cycle in stem cells
with the so-called “Peto’s paradox”—large-bodied, long-
lived animals should have a greater risk of developing
cancer but, in reality, this correlation does not hold true
across multiple species.36 Interestingly, a recent study on
various animal species has corroborated the relationship
between body mass and lifespan and cancer development;
larger animals live longer and have less chance of cancer
morbidity.37 More recent tour de force genetic analysis has
revealed a decreased somatic mutation rate in colon stem
cells, along with the increased body size of animals,
including humans.38 Taken together, long-lived animals may
have experienced an evolutionary force that restrains
excessive proliferation of CoSCs to avert tumor development
and extend their lifespan. From another perspective based
on Peto’s thesis, within the same species, larger individuals
are at a higher risk of developing cancer. Although it is very
interesting to investigate the correlation between body size
and cell cycle speed of CoSCs and cancer risk in humans, the
cohort size of our study is not sufﬁcient to address this
question. We also did not assess the association between the
proportion of slow-cycling LGR5þ cells and other biological
backgrounds, such as sex, age, and ethnicity, and more
extensive work will be warranted to clarify the relationship
between these factors.
In the mouse intestine, ISCs are eradicated by chemo-
therapy and replaced with adjacent differentiated cells
through de-differentiation.39 In contrast, hCoSCs in the
xenotransplanted human colon epithelium persisted during
5-FU treatment and resumed proliferation after treatment
cessation.
The
absence
of
reversion
in
5-FU–induced
mucosal injury was not due to the lack of de-differentiation
competency, as KRT20þ differentiated cells still underwent
de-differentiation upon genetic ablation of hCoSCs. Thus,
our results suggest that the occupancy of hCoSCs in the
niche environment restrained the reversion of adjacent
differentiated cells. The species difference in the role of
stem cells in intestinal regeneration highlights the impor-
tance of studying hCoSCs in human-oriented research.
Indeed, although several growth factors have been found to
facilitate mucosal healing in preclinical mouse models of
intestinal injury, none of them has reached clinical trans-
lation.40,41 Considering the gap between the bench and
bedside, building human-relevant experimental strategies
will be essential for the development of regenerative ther-
apy for mucosal injury and inﬂammatory bowel disease.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed a slow-cycling subpopu-
lation in human LGR5þ colonic cells that exerts stemness
in homeostasis, and prominently after tissue injury.
Although the past decade has seen a certain settlement of
the controversy over the existence of reserve stem cells in
the mouse intestine,39 our ﬁndings illuminated the bio-
logical disparities between human and mouse ISCs and
emphasized the importance of using human-relevant
functional models for accurate understanding of human
stem cell dynamics.

colonic regeneration. Human slow-cycling LGR5þ cells are injury resistant and show clonogenicity in homeostasis and
prominently during regeneration. LGR5–KRT20þ cells de-differentiate into LGR5þ cells and undergo clonogenic expansion
after LGR5 depletion, but not after mucosal injury, suggesting that regeneration in the human colon epithelium after injury rests
on the persistence of slow-cycling LGR5þ cells rather than the plasticity of KRT20þ cells.

Quiescent LGR5+ Stem Cells in the Human Colon 1405
COLON


Supplementary Methods
Human Tissues
A healthy human colon sample for scRNA-seq was ob-
tained from a 78-year-old female that underwent elective
surgery for ascending colon cancer at Tokyo University
Hospital. We had obtained written informed consent
following an approval by the ethical committee of the Uni-
versity of Tokyo under ID G3553-(7). Collected tissues were
kept in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) until use.
Normal colonic organoid lines were previously established
from the ascending colon of a 68-year-old female and from
the descending colon of a 68-year-old male at Keio Uni-
versity Hospital and Tokyo University Hospital, respec-
tively, with written informed consents.1,2 Histopathological
sections of healthy human colonic epithelium were obtained
as a normal counterpart from six patients undergoing tu-
mor resection. The samples were arbitrarily selected irre-
spective of the patient’s gender, age and body mass index.
Mice
All animal procedures were approved by the Keio Uni-
versity School of Medicine Animal Care Committee. Male
NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rgnull (NOG) mice (5-6 weeks old)3 and
C57BL/6 wild-type mice were obtained from the Central
Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA, Japan) and
housed under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. Removal of
the mouse colonic epithelium and subsequent orthotopic
xenotransplantation of human colonic organoids were car-
ried out as previously described.2
Crypt Isolation and Organoid Culture
We performed crypt isolation and cultured human
colonic organoids as previously described.4 Brieﬂy, the
underlying stroma was trimmed from the tissues using
sharp forceps, and the epithelium was further shed into
small fragments of around 1 mm3 in size. Sheared epithe-
lium was further washed with ice-cold PBS at least ﬁve
times and gently rocked in 2.5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) in PBS for 1 hour at 4C on a shaker. Crypts were
isolated by repeated pipetting and centrifuged at 200  g
for 3 min. The crypt palette was suspended in Matrigel
(Corning) on ice. Crypt-laden Matrigel was dispensed onto
48-well
culture
plates
and
following
solidiﬁcation
of
Matrigel droplets, the crypts were overlaid with the
following medium: Advanced Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s
Medium/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) supplemented with
penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc),10 mM
HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc), 1 B-27 Supplement (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc), 10 nM gastrin I (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM N-ace-
tylcysteine (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical), and the niche
factors of 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse Noggin (Pepro-
Tech), 50 ng/ml recombinant mouse EGF (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc), 100 ng/ml recombinant human IGF-1 (Bio-
Legend), 50 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-basic (FGF-2)
(PeproTech), 10% R-spondin1 conditioned medium, 500
nM A83-01 (Tocris) and 20% Afamin-Wnt-3A serum-free
conditioned medium5 as previously reported.4 Organoids
were passaged weekly at a 1:10 split ratio by single cell
dissociation using TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scienti-
ﬁc). We added 10 mM Y-27632 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure
Chemical) for the ﬁrst 2 days after passaging to prevent
anoikis. TGF-b activation in organoids was done by treating
organoids with either 0.1 or 1 ng/ml TGF-b1 (R&D) for 24
hours in an A83-01-free condition. Mouse colonic organoids
were established from 12-week-old Lgr5-DTR-EGFP mice (a
kind gift from F.J. de Sauvage) using the same method as
described above. To exclude the effect of culture condition,
the culture media for human organoids supplemented with
N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) was used to
maintain mouse colonic organoids.
Gene Engineering of Organoids
We generated LGR5-tdTomato, LGR5-iCaspase9-tdTo-
mato (LGR5-iCT), LGR5-CreERT2 , LGR5-NLS-split-Cre and
KRT20-ERCreER knock-in (KI) organoids as previously
described.6 The 20-bp single guide RNA (sgRNA) target
sequences
were
cloned
into
the
px330-U6-Chimer-
ic_BB_CBh-hSpCas9 plasmid (Addgene #42230) for the
generation of LGR5-speciﬁc sgRNA. Donor vectors of the
LGR5 and KRT20 reporters were generated as follows. The
LGR5-GFP and KRT20-GFP vector was ﬁrst generated by
cloning PCR-ampliﬁed 5’ and 3’ homology arms into the
Ires-GFP-loxP-pEF1a-RFP-T2A-puro-loxp plasmid (HR180PA-
1, SBI) using In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Clontech). The GFP
cassette of this vector was replaced with tdTomato, iCas-
pase9-T2A-tdTomato, CreERT2 and NLS-FKBP-F2-Cre60-343
for the assembly of LGR5-tdTomato KI, LGR5-iCT KI,
LGR5 /KRT20-CreERT2 KI and LGR5-NLS-split-CreC KI,
respectively.
The split-Cre system was designed as reported previ-
ously.7,8 Two fragments of Cre, namely CreN and CreC,
derived from Cre codons 19–59 (N-terminal) and 60–343
(C-terminal), respectively. Each Cre fragment was fused to
the FKBP (F36V) domain by F2 linkers, such that dimer-
ization of the two Cre fragments by dimerizer (AP20187,
Clontech) led to the activation of Cre. CreC was synthesized
as NLS (nuclear localization signal)-FKBP (F36V)-F2-CreC
with ﬂanking NheI sites for ligation and was cloned into the
LGR5-KI
vector.
CreN
was
synthesized
as
p27k--F2-
FKBP(F36V)-F2-CreN. This cassette was introduced into
the XLone-GFP plasmid (Addgene #96930) by replacing
the GFP cassette using TAKARA Ligation kit ver.2.1 (Clon-
tech). The sequences of CreN and CreC are available on
request.
For visualization of p27, we cloned the p27-mVenus re-
porter (a gift from T. Kitamura, The University of Tokyo)
into a PiggyBac vector (PB533A-2, SBI). The nGFP-BFP re-
porter was obtained by cloning nGFP-T2A-puro and inverse
TagBFP2 cassettes ﬂanked with loxp sites into a PiggyBac
vector (PB510B-1, SBI). The iRFP-BFP reporter was made
by replacing nGFP with iRFP. The constitutive TagBFP2
expression vector was made by cloning a synthesized
TagBFP2 cassette into a PiggyBac vector (PB510B-1, SBI).

Quiescent LGR5+ Stem Cells in the Human Colon 1406.e1


Gene reporter and CRISPR vectors were introduced into
human normal colonic organoids using electroporation as
reported previously9 with slight modiﬁcations. The elec-
troporated organoids were incubated at 30C for 2 days to
induce cold shock,10 followed by a 2-day selection with 2
mg/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) from 5 days
after
electroporation.
Puromycin-resistant
clones
were
manually picked up and expanded for PCR-based genotyp-
ing. The puromycin-RFP cassette ﬂanked by loxP was sub-
sequently deleted by a transient transfection of organoids
with Cre-expressing adenovirus (TaKaRa) at a multiplicity
of infection of 0.3. RFP-deﬁcient-clones were manually
picked up, and deletion of the puromycin-RFP cassette was
conﬁrmed by genomic PCR. p27-mVenus clones were
selected with 100 mg/ml Geneticin (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc) for human and mouse organoids for 1 week. After
generation of LGR5-iCT p27-mVenus clones, the CreERT2
cassette was knocked-in to the intact LGR5 allele, followed
by the electroporation of the iRFP-BFP vector. In parallel,
LGR5-iCT p27-mVenus organoids were labeled with the BFP-
puro PiggyBac Vector for the visualization of the xeno-
transplanted area. We also used LGR5-CreERT2 rainbow
organoids generated in the previous study.2
Split-Cre organoids were generated by the knock-in of
NLS-FKBP-F2-CreC to the intact LGR5 allele of LGR5-tdTo-
mato organoids, followed by the electro-transfer of XLone-
p27-F2-FKBP-F2-CreN and nGFP-BFP vectors. Organoids
with the expression of XLone reporters were selected by 1-
week treatment with 5 mg/ml of Blasticidin S (FUJIFILM
Wako Pure Chemical). For dimerization of split-Cre, orga-
noids were treated with 250 ng/ml doxycycline (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) overnight 3 days after passaging and
washed with PBS at least 3 times. Four days after doxycy-
cline treatment, we treated the organoids with 500 nM
dimerizer overnight. The sequences of LGR5 and KRT20
sgRNAs and primers for genomic DNA used in this study are
shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Sample and Library Preparation for scRNA-seq
An ascending colon tissue derived from a 78-year-old
female was used for droplet-based scRNA-seq. Following
sampling from a surgically resected specimen, the tissue
was immediately placed into ice-cold PBS and transferred to
the laboratory. The submucosal tissue was trimmed off with
ﬁne scissors and the mucosal layer was cut into small pieces
of around 1 mm3 in size. The sample was treated with 2.5
mM EDTA for 60 min at 4C on a rocking shaker, and crypts
were released by pipetting. Single cells were obtained by
treating crypts with TrypLE Express for 5 min at 37C and
by subsequent ﬁltering through a 20-mm cell strainer. For
puriﬁcation of epithelial cells and removal of dead cells, the
cells were suspended in 200 ml of cold PBS and stained with
5 ml of an APC anti-human CD326 (EpCAM) antibody
(324208, BioLegend) and with DAPI (BD Biosciences,
1:1000) for 20 min, and live EpCAM+ single cells were
sorted into a 1.5-mm tube using a cell sorter (SH800, Sony).
The cells were spun down and suspended in 1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS. Cell density was measured using
Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc), and a total of 17,000 cells were subjected to library
construction. Library construction was performed using
Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit (v2) and a Chip Kit
(10x
Genomics)
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
in-
structions. Sequencing was outsourced (BGI), and the li-
brary
was
sequenced
using
a
HiSeq4000
sequencer
(Illumina) with 100 bp paired-end reads and with 30% of
PhiX Sequencing Control (Illumina) spike-ins for quality
control. For scRNA-seq of the mouse colonic epithelium, we
isolated mouse colonic crypts from 3 female 12-week-old
C57BL/6 mice. For puriﬁcation of epithelial cells and
removal of immune cells and dead cells, the cells were
suspended in 200 ml of cold PBS and stained with 5 ml of
APC anti-mouse CD326 (EpCAM) antibody (118213, Bio-
Legend), PE anti-CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:500)
and DAPI (1:1000) for 20 min. Live CD45– EpCAM+ single
cells were sorted into a 1.5 mm tube using a cell sorter. A
single-cell library was generated following the procedures
used for human tissue.
Data Processing for scRNA-seq
The sequence read data from human colonic epithelial
cells was mapped onto the human genome (GRCh38) using
CellRanger (version 3.0.2) (10x Genomics). CellRanger
detected 8709 cells and 33,538 features from our human
colonic epithelial sample. The count data was imported into
the R package Seurat (version 4.0.3).11 We ﬁltered out cells
with less than 1000 or more than 8000 unique genes, and
those with mitochondrial unique molecular identiﬁer (UMI)
counts over 20%. Finally, we obtained the expression data
of 33,538 features in 7103 cells. After ﬁltration, the median
detected feature was 3148.
The data from mouse colonic epithelial cells was map-
ped onto the mouse genome (GRCm38) using CellRanger.
3638 cells with 31,053 features were obtained. After
ﬁltering out cells with less than 1000 and more than 8000
genes and those with mitochondrial UMI counts over 20%,
1260 cells with the median detected feature of 4447.5 were
retained.
Clustering and Identiﬁcation of Cell Type
Signatures
The count data of human colonic epithelial cells was
normalized and scaled using SCTransform12 and Gamma-
Poisson generalized linear models.13 Principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed using top 3000 variable
genes, followed by uniform manifold approximation and
projection (UMAP) using top 30 principal components. An
SNN graph was constructed using top 30 principal compo-
nents with the FindNeighbors function, and the cells were
classiﬁed using the FindClusters function with the resolu-
tion parameter 0.5. This step clustered the cells into 10
clusters.
To
characterize
each
cluster,
we
performed
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis using the Fin-
dAllMarkers function with the RNA assay. From the gene
expression pattern, we assigned the clusters to early/late
colonocytes, goblet/ immature goblet cells, BEST4/OTOP2

cells, secretory progenitor cells, 3 transient amplifying cell
populations (TA-1, TA-2 and TA-3) and LGR5+ stem cells.
Their RNA assay data was also normalized and scaled by
Seurat for plotting. DEG analysis of the stem cell and early
progenitor subtypes (Stem, TA-1/2/3 and Secretory pro-
genitor) was performed using FindAllMarkers. The thresh-
olds of adjusted P value ¼ 0.01 and mean log2 fold-change
¼ 0.6 were used. The cell cycle score was calculated with
the CellCycleScoring function using S and G2M genes re-
ported previously.14 The ISC score was calculated with the
PercentageFeatureSet function using LGR5, ASCL2, SMOC2,
and AXIN2 genes. The abundance of mouse (Mm) LRC and
Mex3a signatures genes15 in each cell was also calculated
with the PercentageFeatureSet function. From the mouse
intestinal LRC signature and Mex3a-enriched genes, we
used 62 and 208 genes that had human orthologues,
respectively.
Integrative scRNA-seq Analysis Using Public
Datasets
A single-cell gene expression dataset of the human co-
lon16 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
under the accession code GSE116222. We analyzed 4249
cells from 3 healthy subjects (A1, B1, C1). Another single-
cell gene expression data of the human colon17 was
downloaded from Single Cell Portal under the accession
code SCP259. The data by Smillie et al included 49,757
colonic epithelial cells from 12 healthy subjects. To balance
the size with the other datasets, we selected 5557 epithelial
cells from 4 healthy subjects (N16.EpiA, N18.EpiB, N20.EpiB
and N21.EpiB). We ﬁltered out cells with less than 500 and
more than 8000 unique features, and those with mito-
chondrial UMI counts over 30% and obtained data of 4244
and 3457 human colonic epithelial cells from these data.
The medians of detected features were 1451 (Parikh et al)
and 1531 (Smillie et al).
Integrative analysis was performed based on the data
integration framework in the R package Seurat (version
4.0.3).18 Each dataset was normalized with SCTransform,
and passed to the PrepSCTIntegration function using the
2000 integration features selected by the SelectInte-
grationFeatures function. The integration anchors were
extracted by the FindIntegrationAnchors function and used
for data integration using SCT as a normalization method.
PCA was performed using top 2000 variable genes, and
UMAP was performed using top 20 principal components.
An SNN graph was constructed using top 20 principal
components with the FindNeighbors function, and the cells
were classiﬁed using the FindClusters function with the
resolution parameter 0.7.
Comparison of Human and Mouse scRNA-seq
Data
To compare the human and mouse scRNA-seq data, we
ﬁrst obtained public scRNA-seq datasets of the mouse colon
and colonic epithelial cells19,20 from GEO database under
accession codes GSM4569728 and GSM2743164, respec-
tively, to increase the number of mouse cells. Our human
and mouse data and the two public mouse scRNA-seq
datasets were integrated as we did for the human scRNA-
seq datasets, with some modiﬁcations. The feature names in
the mouse data were capitalized to match with the feature
names in human data, and we regressed out the percent
mitochondrial UMI counts and the number of detected
features in the second non-regularized linear regression of
SCTransform.
We performed PCA, followed by UMAP clustering using
top 20 principal components. Of the 7496 mouse cells in
Brugger et al data and 1739 in Herring et al, we extracted
2706 and 1736 cells, respectively, with a membership in the
Epcam-positive cluster. By ﬁltering out cells with less than
500 or more than 8000 detected genes and those with
mitochondrial RNA proportion above 25%, we obtained
1404 and 655 mouse colonic epithelial cells with median
detected features of 2383 and 3186 from Brugger et al and
Herring et al datasets, respectively.
Orthotopic Xenotransplantation of Human
Colonic Organoids
Removal of the mouse colonic epithelium and subse-
quent orthotopic xenotransplantation of human colonic
organoids were carried out as previously described.2 Male
NOG mice (7–10 weeks) were fed with a normal diet and
housed in a room with a regular 12-hour light cycle (8:00-
20:00 light, 20:00-8:00 dark). Before the xenograft experi-
ment, mice were allowed to produce as much feces as
possible while running around in the cage by a long-term
inhalation of 1.5–2% isoﬂurane. For the removal of the
mouse colonic epithelium, the mouse colonic lumen was
washed with PBS for the removal of luminal contents and
debris using a thin catheter (ﬂexible animal feeding needle,
Fuchigami). We inserted a hand-made thin catheter (1 mm
in diameter) with a small balloon at the tip into the mouse
anus. The colonic mucosa was infused with hot EDTA (250
mM, 50–55C) using another catheter for 2–3 minutes and
by closing the oral and anal ends of the rectum with the
inﬂated balloon and tweezers (HSC702-93; Hammacher),
respectively. The lumen was washed with PBS, followed by
the decanulation of the balloon-tipped catheter. We then
removed the native colonic mucosa by scraping the
epithelium off the colonic wall with a vibrating electric
toothbrush (EW-DL22, EW0945; Panasonic Corporation).
Speciﬁcally, the brush tip was inserted into the distal colon
from the anus and gently pressed onto the inner surface of
the lumen wall, allowing crypts to be mechanically rubbed
off from the submucosal layer. Successful removal of crypts
was conﬁrmed as a release of isolated crypts from the
vibrating toothbrush into a water-ﬁlled petri dish. The
balloon-tipped catheter was inserted again to wash the
lumen with PBS.
Orthotopic xenotransplantation of human colonic orga-
noids labelled with ﬂuorescent reporters was performed
within 2 hours after the removal of the colonic epithelium in
recipient mice. Before engraftment, the organoids were
grown in suspension culture for 3–4 days after single-cell
passaging using the culture medium supplemented with 2–
November 2022
Quiescent LGR5+ Stem Cells in the Human Colon 1406.e3


2.5% (vol/vol) Matrigel and ultra-low attachment 6-well
culture plates (Corning). Following a rough estimation of
total cells in organoids by cell counting, the organoids were
suspended in PBS supplemented with 10% (vol/vol)
Matrigel, and 70 ml of the organoid suspension containing 1
 106 cells was injected into the recipient colon using a 200
ml pipette. To temporarily maintain the transplanted orga-
noids in the colon, we covered the anus of mice with an
adhesive (AronAlpha 31303; Toagosei) and a small piece of
soft paper, which was manually removed 3–6 hours after
transplantation. We carefully monitored defecation from
recipient mice for 1 week to check for the occurrence of
bowel obstruction. In total, 6 organoid lines with ﬂuores-
cent reporters were xenotransplanted orthotopically and
analyzed in this experiment.
Mouse Colonoscopy
Successful orthotopic engraftment of organoids was
conﬁrmed by endoscopy as previously described.2 Brieﬂy,
the ﬂuorescence of engrafted organoids was observed > 14
days after transplantation using a high-deﬁnition 3-charge
coupled device camera system (Image 1 Hub HD H3-Z; Karl
Storz) and 300 Watt Xenon light source (D-Light C; Karl
Storz). The camera-tipped-HOPKINS telescope (1.9 mm
outer diameter, length 10 cm; Karl Storz) was inserted and
guided into the recipient mouse rectum via transanal
approach after a removal of remnant stools. Endoscopic
images were ﬁlmed and recorded in both bright ﬁeld and
ﬂuorescence imaging. We considered orthotopic xeno-
transplantation to have succeeded when ﬂuorescence-
expressing areas were evident > 28 days after trans-
plantation. To measure the xenograft area at multiple time-
points after dimerizer treatment, we inserted a biopsy for-
ceps (61071ZJ; Karl Storz) into the mouse rectum through
the working channel of the colonoscopy and used its size as
the reference area in bright ﬁeld. Then, ﬂuorescent GFP+
areas were ﬁlmed from the closest approaching location at
the indicated time points. The measurement of the GFP+
area was done using the Fiji (ImageJ) software.
Mouse Drug Treatment
Each mouse was euthanized around the same time in a
day to minimize the adverse effect of circadian rhythms on
the proliferation state.21 For the LRC experiments, each
mouse was continuously treated with EdU (10 mg/kg;
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) intraperitoneally every 8 hour
over 4 days, and the tissues were assessed on 0.5, 14, 21,
and 28 days after last EdU treatment. Mucosal injury was
induced by 2 rounds of daily intraperitoneal injection of
100 mg/kg 5-FU (Kyowa Kirin). Donor human crypts and
recipient mouse crypts were assessed in the same mice. In
lineage tracing experiments, each mouse received a single
intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg tamoxifen (Sigma-
Aldrich) diluted in 200 ml corn oil and treated with a single
150 mg/kg 5-FU treatment on 3 days after tamoxifen in-
jection, because 3 days were required for the recombination
and visualization of rainbow-expressing cells.2 For LGR5
p27 split-Cre tracing in vivo, p27 CreN expression was
induced by a 6-day treatment with 1 mg/ml doxycycline in
drinking water. The 2 Cre fragments were dimerized by at
least 3 rounds of daily intraperitoneal treatment with 250
mg of dimerizer. Mucosal injury was induced by a single
intraperitoneal injection with 150 mg/kg 5-FU on 3 days
after the last dimerizer injection. Day 0 was deﬁned as the
day of the 5-FU treatment and split-Cre-traced tissues were
analyzed on day 0 and day 28. For LGR5 ablation experi-
ments, xenograft-bearing mice received 40 mg of dimerizer
for 5 consecutive days. For LGR5-iCT/KRT20-ERCreER
lineage tracing experiments, each mouse received a single
intraperitoneal injection of 0.5–2 mg tamoxifen (Sigma-
Aldrich) diluted in 200 ml corn oil. The mice were treated
either with a single 150 mg/kg 5-FU treatment on the
following day after tamoxifen injection or with a single 100
mg of dimerizer on the same day as tamoxifen injection.
Xenograft tissues were analyzed on day 3, 14, and 28 for
control, on day 14 for dimerizer and 5-FU treatment groups.
Organoid Whole-mount Staining
Human colonic organoids were grown for 5–7 days after
single-cell passaging for whole-mount staining. The orga-
noids were isolated from Matrigel using Cell Recovery So-
lution (Corning) for 30 min on ice and ﬁxed in 4% PFA for
20 min at room temperature. The organoids were washed
with PBS 3 times, blocked with 10 diluted Power Block
Universal Reagent (BioGenx) at room temperature for 10
min, and reacted with a primary antibody in the per-
meabilization buffer (0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS) on a
shaking rocker at 4C overnight. The organoids were
washed with PBS 3 times and labelled with a secondary
antibody at room temperature for 30 min and with Hoechst
33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for nuclear counter-
staining. Stained organoids were suspended in ProLong
Diamond Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc),
mounted onto a 35-mm glass bottom dish and observed
using a confocal microscope (SP8, Leica). Primary and sec-
ondary antibodies used in this experiment were as follows:
mouse anti-p27 (F-8) (1:200; sc-1641, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:100; ab16667; Abcam), and
Alexa 488, 568, 647-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
antibody (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Tissue Immunohistochemistry,
Immunoﬂuorescence and In Situ Hybridization
The preparation of samples from mouse or colon xeno-
graft tissue for immunoﬂuorescence or immunohistochem-
istry was carried out by ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 6–18 hours, followed by the trimming of ﬂuores-
cence-labelled donor human colonic crypts under a stereo-
microscope
(Nikon,
Lumina
Vision).
The
tissues
for
immunoﬂuorescence staining were immersed in 30% su-
crose overnight and subsequently embedded in OCT com-
pound (Tissue-Tek). For cryosectional analysis, the tissues
were sectioned with an 8 mm thickness. For tissue whole-
mounting and 3-dimensional imaging, the donor human co-

2–3 days with gentle shaking. Parafﬁn-embedded tissues
were sectioned with 4 mm and 7 mm thicknesses for immu-
nohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. For
immunostaining, the following primary antibodies were
used: rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:100; ab16667; Abcam), rat anti-
Ki67 (SolA15) (1:100; 14-5698-82; Thermo Fisher Scienti-
ﬁc), rabbit anti-p27 (1:100; ab32034; Abcam), mouse anti-
p21 (F-5) (1:100; sc-6246; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
anti-p57 (1:500; P0357; Sigma), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500;
PM005; MBL), mouse anti-KRT20 (Ks20.8) (1:50; M7019;
Dako), rabbit anti-Mucin2 (H-300) (1:100; sc-15334; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Villin (C-19) (1:100; sc-7672;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Chromogranin A (C-20)
(1:100; sc-1488; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-
Chromogranin A (C-12) (1:100; sc-393941; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), goat anti-GFP (1:200; ab6673, Abcam),
rabbit anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 (1:100; 9661, Cell Signaling),
rabbit anti-SMAD3 (phospho S423 + S425) (EP823Y) (1:20;
ab52903; Abcam), and rabbit anti-tagRFP (1:1000; Evrogen).
Alexa 488-, 568-, 647-conjugated anti-rabbit, -mouse, -goat
antibodies (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) were used as
secondary antibodies. Nuclear counterstaining was per-
formed using Hoechst 33342 (1:1000; H3570; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). For EdU detection was done using the Click-iT Plus
EdU Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). In situ hybridi-
zation was performed using the RNAscope 2.5HD kit
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. We used cryosections for the analysis of lineage
tracing and parafﬁn-embedded sections for all the other an-
alyses, respectively. The probes used in this study were hu-
man LGR5 probe (311021), mouse Lgr5 probe (312171), and
positive (PPIB) and negative (DapB) control probes. The
sections were visualized using an SP8 confocal microscope
(Leica) or a BZ-X800 digital microscope (Keyence). Images
were analyzed using Fiji.
Confocal Counting Experiments
The status of Ki67 in LGR5+ or Lgr5+ cells following 5-
FU-induced injury was assessed by counting the number of
Ki67+ and LGR5+ cells in donor human crypts and recipient
mouse crypts. In LRC experiments, LRC was deﬁned as EdU+
cell located between the crypt bottom and the 10th cellular
position from the crypt base at the indicated time points,
and the numbers of LGR5 (Lgr5)+ cells and LGR5+ EdU+
cells were counted manually in each crypt at each time
point. In section analyses, we excluded slantly sectioned
crypts, speciﬁcally the crypts that did not have a typical U-
shape. A uniform laser intensity was used in each assess-
ment.
In
LGR5-p27-LRC
reporter
experiments,
LGR5+
(tdTomato) cells, p27+ (mVenus) cells, and LRCs were
counted up to the 10th position from the crypt bottom. The
expression of the LGR5 and p27 reporters was analyzed
using the 3D object Counter plugin in Fiji.
Flow Cytometry and Colony Forming Efﬁciency
Analysis
For the analysis of organoid formation from single cells,
LGR5-p27-reporter organoids grown for 5 days after
passaging were dissociated into single cells in TrypLE Ex-
press at 37C for 25 min and ﬁltered through a 20-mm cell
strainer (Partec). The cells were washed with PBS and
stained with DRAQ7 (Biostatus) to mark dead cells. The
cells were analyzed and sorted using a ﬂow cytometer with
a 100-mm sorting chip (FACS SH800, SONY). Single cells
were gated based on the SSC-H versus SSC-W proﬁle. The
ﬂuorescence of p27-mVenus, LGR5-tdTomato and DRAQ7
was excited using 488 nm, 561 nm, and 638 nm using 525/
50, 617/30 and 665/30 bandpass ﬁlters, respectively. We
used single-colored organoids (namely, tdTomato-express-
ing organoids and mVenus-expressing organoids) and con-
trol organoids for the ﬂuorescence compensation of p27-
mVenus and LGR5-tdTomato. The gated cells (10 cells per
gate) were sorted onto slides, and the correct ﬂuorescence
was conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy. For each cell pop-
ulation, 1000 cells or 2000 cells were sorted and seeded in
a 20 ml droplet of Matrigel per well. The culture medium
was supplemented with 10 mM Y-27632 for the ﬁrst two
days. Images were captured on day 5 and day 7 post sorting
using a BZ-X800 digital microscope (Keyence). Colony
numbers and total colony areas were measured using the
BZ-X800 analyzer software (Keyence). Three or 4 replicates
were generated for each of the 2 independent LGR5-tdTo-
mato lines.
In vitro Live Imaging
Human organoids for in vitro live imaging were plated in
10 ml of Matrigel on a 96-well plate (IWAKI). The growth
medium was refreshed every 3 days, and the organoids
were treated with 10 mM 5-FU for 1 day and washed with
PBS at least 3 times where indicated. Wells in the outer 2
rows and columns of the plates were not used for imaging
to minimize the ﬂuctuations in laser intensity, temperature
and humidity, and were ﬁlled with PBS to prevent medium
evaporation. Organoids were maintained at 37C and 5%
CO2 for the indicated days using a stage-top incubator.
Time-lapse in vitro live imaging was carried out using an
inverted
confocal
quantitative
image
cytometer
CQ1
(Yokogawa Electric Corporation). BFP, p27-mVenus, LGR5-
tdTomato, and iRFP were excited using 405 nm, 488 nm,
and 561 nm, and 640 nm lasers and collected using 447/60,
525/60,
617/73,
and
685/40
nm
band
pass
ﬁlters,
respectively. A 20 dry objective lens (NA 0.75) was used
to capture high-resolution ﬂuorescence images. The images
in the indicated areas were captured every 8 hours over 4
consecutive days for the observation of nonperturbed
organoid growth, and every 12 hours over 14 days for 5-FU
experiments. Z-stack images were ﬁlmed at 3–5 mm depth
intervals for each organoid. Cell tracking analysis and
graphing were performed automatically using the Cell-
Pathﬁnder CQ1 software (Yokogawa Electric Corporation).
Nontrackable cells and the cells that showed dynamics
inconsistent with the manual time tracking results were
excluded from the analyses. For mouse Lgr5-GFP/p27-
mVenus organoids, live imaging was performed on a
confocal microscope (SP8, Leica) because CQ1 could not
separate the wavelength of Venus from that of GFP. Lgr5-

GFP and p27-mVenus were excited using 488 nm and 514
nm lasers. A 20 dry objective lens (NA 0.75) was used to
capture high-resolution ﬂuorescence images.
Three-dimensional Ex Vivo Imaging and
Counting Experiments
Transparent tissue specimens in LapiClear 1.49 were
placed onto 35-mm glass base dishes (IWAKI) and mounted
with a 18-mm micro cover slip (Matsunami Glass) on glue.
The dish was placed upside down with water poured onto
the backside of the dish bottom. Fluorescence 3D imaging
was performed using an upright multiphoton laser scanning
microscope system A1R MP+ with GaAsP NDD (Nikon). Tag
BFP2, nuclear GFP and tdTomato were excited with 820 nm,
900 or 960 nm, and 1040 nm lasers and collected with <
498 nm, 498–560 nm and 560–593 nm ﬂuorescein ﬁlters,
respectively. To eliminate the signal of second harmonic
generation (SHG) from Tag BFP2 images, < 498 nm-ﬁltered
images on 900 nm emission was subtracted from < 498
nm-ﬁltered images on 820 nm emission. Z-stack images
were captured at a 3 mm interval. The images were median-
ﬁltered, merged and 3D-reconstructed using the Fiji soft-
ware. We considered that when 2 given BFP-expressing
cells were located more than 10 cells apart from each other,
they were derived from different BFP+ clones. BFP-
expressing cells localized to the crypt top and did not
extend from the crypt bottom or LGR5-tdTomato cells were
excluded from the analysis.
RNA-sequencing
RNA was extracted from organoids using the RNeasy
Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was measured using
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and all samples passed
the quality check (RNA Integrity Number > 7.0). Sequence
library was prepared with TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2
(Illumina) and sequenced with HiSeq 4000, NovaSeq 6000
or HiSeq X Ten (Illumina). RNA sequencing was outsourced
to GENEWIZ. Adaptors were removed from raw fastq ﬁles
with cutadapt (version 1.18) and the reads were aligned to
hg38 using STAR (version 2.6.1). The expression levels of
the human genes in Ensembl release 81 were estimated
with RSEM (version 1.3.3). The concordance of the gene
expression proﬁles across the organoids was assessed as
the Pearson’s correlation of log10(TPM + 0.001) values of all
genes.
Exome Sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from organoids using the
QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was treated with
RNase Cocktail (Ambion). Three micrograms of genomic
DNA were subject to whole exome sequencing. 150 bp
paired-end libraries were prepared using the SureSelect
Human All Exon V6 kit (Agilent) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Cleaned fastq ﬁles were mapped
onto the human reference genome version GRCh37 (hg19)
using BWA-MEM (version 0.7.17). Data cleanup and variant
detection were performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit
(GATK, version 4.1.2.0). PCR duplicates were marked, and
then base quality score recalibration was applied. Variant
detection was performed using Mutect2. To remove germ-
line variants, the detected variants were ﬁltered by
removing those detected with allele frequency of 0.1% or
more in dbSNP or the Japanese germline variant database
(the Human Genetic Variation Database).22 Genotypes of
53,867 exonic germline variants registered in HapMap
(version
3
release
3)
were
compared
using
Cross-
checkFingerprints (GATK version 4.1.2.0).
Real-time Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from organoids using RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using High
Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). qPCR
was carried out using Universal Probe Library probes and
FastStart Essential DNA Probes Master (Roche) on a Light-
Cycler 96 device (Roche). Relative gene expression levels
were analyzed by delta-delta CT method using ACTB as a
house keeping gene.
Mathematical Estimation of Cell Cycle Length
To estimate the cell cycle length in the non-dividing
LGR5+ subpopulation and LGR5-expressing TA cells, we
counted the frequencies of EdU+ cells in all LGR5+ cells on
days 0.5, 14, and 21 after an EdU pulse. As LGR5+Ki67- cells
(LGR5+p27+ cells) were distributed around the +0 to +4 cell
position (Figure 1E) in native human colon crypts, we
measured the frequency of EdU+LGR5+ cells in +0 to +4
positions (stem cells) and in +4 to +10 positions (TA cells).
We deﬁned the duration of the S phase in the human colonic
epithelium as 6 hours based on the in vitro live imaging
results using Fucci reporter organoids (not shown). We
assumed that all cells were labeled with EdU when Li (cell
cycle length) < x (pulse duration) + 6 (length of S phase),
and that the proportion of labeled cells was (x + 6)/Li when
Li > x + 6. We set up an equation using the proportion of
labeled cells at x ¼ 24 and 96 (hr) and obtained the
following solutions: L1 (stem cell) ¼ 7.1 days for x ¼ 96
(hr), and L1 (stem cell) ¼ 7.3 days and L2 (TA cell) ¼ 1.5
days for x ¼ 24 (hr).
Statistical Analysis
The comparison between separate groups was per-
formed using unpaired 2-tailed t-test. The difference of
clone sizes in control and 5-FU-treated groups in split-Cre
experiments was analyzed using a linear mixed models and
likelihood ratio test. The P value < .05 was deﬁned as
signiﬁcantly different. Asterisks in the ﬁgures indicate the
following P values: *P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001; n.s. P >
.05. Statistical analysis and graph visualization was per-
formed on the R software. The box in box-whisker plots
demonstrates the interquartile range (Q1, Q3), with the
median (Q2) as a line in the box. The upper whisker ¼ Q3 +
1.5 (Q - Q1) and the lower whisker ¼ Q1 - 1.5 (Q3 - Q1).
Where given, N (the number of replicates) refers to the
number of different individuals and mice.

Supplementary Figure 4. Global expression and genotype of nonengineered, gene-engineered, and post-xenotransplanted
human organoids, related to Figure 3. (A) Pearson’s correlation of the transcriptomes of nonengineered, gene-engineered,
and post-xenotransplanted organoids. Log10(transcripts per million þ 0.001) values of all genes were used for comparison.
The identity of each organoid is as follows; 1: patient 1 nonengineered organoids, 2: patient 1 LGR5-iCT organoids (single
knock-in), 3: patient 1 LGR5-tdTomato/p27 split-Cre organoids (double KI), 4: patient 1 post-xenotransplanted LGR5-iCT GFP
organoids from mouse #1, 5: patient 1 post-xenotransplanted LGR5-iCT GFP organoids from mouse #2, 6: patient1 post-
xenotransplanted LGR5-iCT GFP organoids from mouse #3, 7: patient 2 nonengineered organoids, and 8: patient 2 LGR5-
iCT organoids. (B) Exome-based DNA copy-number analysis. The chromosome region in 9p had few single nucleotide
polymorphisms in our panel of normal used in the analysis, and the gain-like regions in organoids 3–7 are considered to be
artefacts based on in-depth interrogation of the regional allele frequency. Organoid IDs refer to those in (A).

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is charac-
terized by pathological ectopic ossification of the spinal ligaments, 
resulting in serious neurological dysfunction and server thoracic 
myelopathy due to stenosis of the spinal canal. The clinical features 
of TOLF are generally progressive and usually rarely responsive to 
conservative treatments except for surgical interventions.1–­

studies have suggested the possible effects of mechanical stress,4,5 
inflammatory factors,6,7 and genetic factors8,9 that were contributed 
to the aetiology and pathogenesis of TOLF. However, the cellular 
and molecular mechanisms underlying are still not fully elucidated.
The development and progression of TOLF can be histologically 
described based on endochondral ossification.10 The ossified lesion 
in the spinal ligament contains both chondrocytes and osteoblasts, 
regulated by various transcriptional factors. Among those, leucine-­

coupled receptors (LGRs), which

Abstract
Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is ectopic ossification of the 
spinal ligaments. Histologically, the development of TOLF can be described as the 
process of endochondral ossification. However, the underlying aetiology has not been 
completely clarified. In this investigation, the gene expression profile associated with 
leucine-­
rich repeat-­
containing G-­
protein-­
coupled receptors (LGR) and Wnt signal-
ling pathway in the thoracic ligamentum flavum cells (TLFCs) of different ossifica-
tion stages was analysed via RNA sequencing. We further confirmed the significant 
differences in the related gene expression profile by Gene Ontology (GO) enrich-
ment analysis. LGR5 was first identified in primary human TLFCs during osteogenic 
differentiation. To evaluate the effect of LGR5 on osteogenic differentiation, LGR5 
has been knocked down and overexpressed in human TLFCs. We observed that the 
knockdown of LGR5 inhibited the activity of Wnt signalling and attenuated the poten-
tial osteogenic differentiation of TLFCs, while overexpression of LGR5 activated the 
Wnt signalling pathway and increased osteogenic differentiation. Our results provide 
important evidence for the potent positive mediatory effects of LGR5 on osteogen-
esis by enhancing the Wnt signalling pathway in TOLF.

7-­
transmembrane protein superfamily, are involved in the transmis-
sion of signals during homeostasis, bone remodelling and regenera-
tive processes.11,12 It has been noted that the expressions of various 
LGRs were involved in multiple bone-­
specific cell types, including 
osteoblasts, osteoclasts and their progenitor populations. Recent 
studies have recognized LGR4, LGR5 and LGR6 as receptors of the 
R-­
spondin proteins (RSPOs) family, which is comprised of four highly 
related secreted glycoproteins, RSPO1 to 4, respectively.13–­
15 By 
binding to RSPOs, LGR5 homologues were shown to modulate the 
activation of Wnt signalling pathway.12 The canonical Wnt signalling 
pathway is widely recognized as essential during the processes of 
bone formation and homeostasis. Furthermore, results from previ-
ous studies have also suggested Wnt signalling pathway might reg-
ulate the chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during the development 
of ossification of the spinal ligament.16,17 However, the functional 
involvement of LGRs in the process of TOLF through Wnt signalling 
pathway is still needed to be addressed.
In the present study, we identified the LGRs that were specifi-
cally expressed in the thoracic ligamentum flavum cells (TLFCs) at 
different ossification stages by RNA sequencing based on micro-­
computed tomography (micro-­
CT) analysis, and further concluded 
that LGR5 promoted the osteogenesis in human TLFCs by activating 
Wnt signalling pathway.
2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1  |  Patient specimens
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee for 
Human Subjects of Peking University Third Hospital and performed 
in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (PUTH-­
REC-­
SOP-­
06-­
3.0-­
A27, #2014003). Written Informed consent for the study was 
obtained from all patients. We retrospectively investigated the data 
of patients who have been diagnosed with TOLF from August 2015 
to December 2018. The patients with cervical myelopathy, ossifica-
tion of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), thoracic lumbar 
disc herniation, trauma, infection, deformity and other spinal disor-
ders were excluded. A total of 28 patients diagnosed with TOLF who 
underwent decompressive laminectomy through posterior midline 
approach were enrolled in the study.
2.2  |  Micro-­
CT evaluation and measurements
The lamina was completely resected by an ultrasonic bone curette, 
preserving the whole ossified mass intact to keep the integrity of the 
ligamentum flavum tissue. All lamina specimens were evaluated by 
micro-­
CT using Inveon Acquisition Workplace (InveonTM, Siemens 
Medical Solutions) in alignment of the protocol we described previ-
ously.18 Three-­
dimensional region of interest (ROI) was generated 
by manually depicted around the sites of ossified mass for subse-
quent analysis. We manually classified the ligamentum flavum to 3 
different ossification stages of initial ossification (IO), immature os-
sification (IMO) and mature ossification (MO), based on the imaging 
features of micro-­
CT. The ossification initiated at the attachment 
site of flavum ligament on lamina, low-­
density hypertrophic liga-
mentum flavum was usually observed in IO stage. A bony shell en-
veloping the ligamentum flavum was then gradually formed from the 
attachment site on cranial and caudal lamina in IMO stage, with the 
decrease of normal structure. The bony shell structure increasingly 
thickened and fused in MO stage to form an ossified mass, similar to 
those observed in bone tissues, characterized by ligamentum flavum 
tissue been replaced by high-­
density ossified structures (Figure 1A). 
The ossification degree was then categorized by calculating mor-
phological parameters.
2.3  |  Haematoxylin & eosin and 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis
The resected ligament samples of different ossification stages were 
fixed in 10% buffered formalin and 10% formic acid for 1–­
4 weeks. 
After embedding in paraffin wax, the samples were deparaffinized 
and rehydrated, and then sectioned to 4 μm thick. Serial sections 
from different ossification stages were stained with haematoxylin 
& eosin following standard procedures. Representative sections for 
IHC staining were performed according to the manufacturer's man-
ual as we described previously.19 The sections were incubated with 
the following mouse monoclonal Anti-­
LGR5 primary antibody (1:100, 
Abcam) at 4°C after antigen retrieval with horse serum (ZSGB-­
BIO), 
washed with PBS three times later and then treated with goat anti-­
mouse IgG (ZSGB-­
BIO) at room temperature for 30 min. To visualize 
the antibody binding reaction, sections were incubated with a diam-
inobenzidine (DAB) solution (ZSGB-­
BIO), and nuclear counterstain-
ing was performed with haematoxylin.
2.4  |  Cell culture and osteogenic differentiation
Cell culture was conducted in accordance with the protocol as de-
scribed in our previous study.9 The ligament samples were collected 
during the patients' surgery procedures, washed with phosphate-­
buffered saline (PBS) immediately. Based on the imaging features 
of micro-­
CT analysis, the ligament samples were removed care-
fully from the ossified tissue under sterilized conditions. For IO 
stage, the samples away from the initiated ossified lesion at the at-
tachment site of the ligament were harvested; for IMO stage, the 
samples adjacent to the ossified bony shell were used for the cell 
culture; for MO stage, the samples around the fusion site of the os-
sified mass were resected (Figure S1). The collected samples were 
minced into approximately 0.5 mm3 pieces, and then digested with 
250 U/ml type I collagenase (Sigma-­
Aldrich) at 37°C for 4  h and 
0.25% trypsin (Gibco) at 37°C for 1 h. Next, the specimen was cul-
tured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) added 
10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/

ml streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. The osteogenic medium was 
supplemented with 50 μM ascorbic acid (Sigma-­
Aldrich), 10 mM 
β-­
glycerophosphate (Sigma-­
Aldrich) and 10  nM dexamethasone 
(Sigma-­
Aldrich) to induce the osteogenic differentiation. Cells from 
the third passage were used for the subsequent experiments.
2.5  |  RNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA se-
quencing was performed by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology. 
Samples from four patients who had multiple-­
level ossification were 
examined by RNA sequencing; the primary TLFCs of different os-
sification stages isolated from the same patient was served as a 
self-­
control group. GO (http://www.geneo​
ntolo​
gy.org/) enrichment 
analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by 
the clusterProfiler R package (Version 6.8). GO terms with corrected 
p < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by DEGs.
2.6  |  Quantitative real-­
time polymerase chain 
reaction analysis
Quantitative real-­
time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-­
PCR) was 
performed using amiDETECTA Track miRNA qRT-­
PCR Starter kit 
(RiboBio) and SYBR Green I (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's 
manual as we described previously.7 The relative gene expression lev-
els were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences

2.7  |  Western blot analysis
A total of 50 μg protein was separated by SDS-­
PAGE gel and trans-
ferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) that were blocked with 5% 
bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated with primary an-
tibodies. Next, the samples were probed with appropriate HRP-­
conjugated anti-­
IgG and followed by detection with ChemiDoc 
XRS+ chemiluminescence system (Bio-­
Rad Laboratories, Inc.). 
The following rabbit-­
anti-­
human monoclonal antibodies obtained 
from Abcam were used: anti-­
LGR5 (1:1000); anti-­
Runx2 (1:1000); 
anti-­
Osterix (1:2000); anti-­
ALP (1:2000); anti-­

β-­
cantenin (1:1000) and anti-­
GAPDH 
(1:2500).
2.8  |  Alkaline phosphatase activity assay
After 7 days of osteogenic induction, TLFCs (1 × 105 /well) were 
seeded in 6-­
well plates and cultured in osteogenic medium for 
7 days. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was assessed by an 
ALP activity staining kit (GENMED Scientifics), in accordance with 
the manufacturer's protocol recommendations.
2.9  |  Lentiviral transfection of thoracic ligamentum 
flavum cells
The lentivirus-­
based vectors for knockdown (short hairpin RNA, 
shRNA) and overexpression of LGR5 were ordered from Hanbio. 
The sequences of the shRNA-­
LGR5 (Lv-­
shLGR5) were listed as fol-

A negative control shRNA (NC) with non-­
complementary sequences 
was used as control. Lentivirus vectors encoding the whole length 
of human LGR5 (Lv-­
LGR5) was transfected in TLFCs for LGR5 over-
expression. Empty lentivirus vectors were used as negative control 
(Lv-­
NC). The primary TLFCs of initial ossification stage were seeded 
in a 100 mm dish with a density of 5 x 105 /well. The transfection 
mix with a solution of 100 μl consisting of 5 x 105 PFU lentivirus was 
added to the dish on day 2, and then, the cells were incubated in 
5% CO2 at 37°C for 7 days. Stable knockdown and overexpression 
of LGR5 in the TLFCs were verified by both qRT-­
PCR and Western 
blot analysis.
2.10  |  Inhibitor of Wnt response 1 (IWR-­

inhibitory assay
Thoracic ligamentum flavum cells at the initial ossification stage with 
or without stable LGR5 overexpression were treated with IWR-­
1 
(10μM, Sigma-­
Aldrich) for 48 h during culture in osteogenic differ-
entiation medium. TLFCs without the transfection of lentivirus were 
served as blank group (Blank).
2.11  |  Statistical analysis
All values were presented as mean ± SD. Each experiment was per-
formed in triplicate. Comparisons between two groups were as-
sessed by two-­
tailed t-­
test, and comparisons among three or more 
groups were analysed using one-­
way analysis of variance (anova). 
Data were evaluated by SPSS 24.0 and statistical significance was 
defined as p < 0.05.

3.1  |  Morphological characteristics of ossified 
ligamentum flavum in thoracic ligamentum flavum cells
A total of 56 samples were collected from 28 TOLF patients (14 
male and 14 female) with a mean age of 54.74 ± 9.25 years. Three 
different ossification stages of TOLF including initial ossification 
(IO), immature ossification (IMO) and mature ossification (MO) 
were observed on micro-­
CT images (Figure 1A). IO of the ligamen-
tum flavum was detected only at the attachment point, without 
bony shell, whereas IMO and MO were observed either on the 
bony shell or the ossified mass along the lamina. Of all samples, 11 
were at the IO stage, 21 at the IMO stage and 24 at the MO stage. 
The ossification stages were identified by morphological measure-
ments in ROI (Figure 1B).
3.2  |  DEGs of TLFCs in different ossification stages 
established via RNA-­
sequencing
Totally, a number of 3108 DEGs were identified in the IO-­
IMO, 
IMO-­
MO and IO-­
MO groups of TOLF (Figure 1C). To identify the 
DEGs that contributed to the osteogenic feature of the TLFCs of 
different ossification stage, we examined the overlaps of the DEGs 
expression in three groups, where 11 overlapping DEGs were 
identified, including LGR5, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and 
fibulin-­
2 (FBLN2). Higher expression of LGR5 was observed in IO 
group compared with IMO (>1.96 fold) and MO (>17.19 fold) groups. 
A total of 374 DEGs were shared exclusively between the IO-­
MO 
and IMO-­
MO groups, where Wnt5a (<0.36 fold, IO vs. MO), FZD3 
(<0.32 fold, IO vs. MO), COL11A1 (<0.20 fold, IO vs. MO) and Runx2

(<0.27 fold, IO vs. MO) were detected. Meanwhile, RSPO2 (>7.37 
fold) and LRP6 (<0.58 fold) were also identified as the DEGs in the 
IO-­
MO group together with other osteogenesis-­
related factors, in-
cluding Osterix, Runx2 and ALP. The distinctive DEGs expressed in 
the TLFCs of different ossification stages are presented in the heat 
map (Figure 1D). The heat map with showname of DEGs was submit-
ted as Supporting Information (Data S1). The full lists of DEGs were 
shown in Table S1-­
3.
Gene Ontology analysis was performed to further investigate 
the biological functions of the identified DEGs in the TLFCs. The 
results indicated that most of the DEGs were enriched in Wnt signal-
ling pathway and ossification (Table 1).
3.3  |  Expression of LGR5 at different ossification 
stages in TOLF Sections
The expression of LGR5 in the fibroblast-­
like cells was further 
confirmed by IHC analysis. The strongly expression of LGR5 was 
observed in the regularly arranged elastic fibres with hyperplas-
tic collagen fibres away from the ossified lesion in IO stage, then 
decreased in the compacted collagen fibres with calcification ad-
jacent to the ossified lesion in IMO stage. In MO stage, the ex-
pression of LGR5 was further lowered in the calcified area with 
disappearance of fibre bundles at the fusion site of ossified mass 
(Figure 2).
3.4  |  Expression level of LGR5 and Wnt signalling 
in primary TLFCs
To confirm the functional relevance of the DEGs, we compared 
the mRNA expression level of LGR5, Wnt signalling activity and 
osteogenic capacities of the primary TLFCs of different ossifica-
tion stages. The cells at the IO stage had a higher expression 
level of LGR5 than those at the IMO and MO stages. The ex-
pression of LGR5 decreased during ossification, on the contrary, 
Wnt3a, Wnt5a, LRP6, FZD3 and β-­
catenin were significantly 
increased (Figure  3A). The elevated expression of the osteo-
genic markers was observed in the TLFCs of different ossifica-
tion stages as well (Figure 3B). ALP staining was performed on 
Day 7 (Figure 3C). Our findings were consistent with the RNA-­
sequencing data.
3.5  |  LGR5 knockdown inhibits the Wnt 
signalling and osteogenic differentiation in 
primary TLFCs
To validate whether LGR5 is involved in osteogenic differentiation, 
we knocked down LGR5 by delivering specific Lv-­
shRNA. The signif-
icant reduced expression of LGR5 in the TLFCs was then confirmed. 
Similarly, the mRNA and protein expression levels Wnt signalling 
were also found to be decreased (Figure 4A,C), as well as the osteo-
genic markers (Figure 4B). Attenuated ALP activity was detected in 
the LGR5 knockdown cells as well (Figure 4D). These results sug-
gested that the LGR5 knockdown inhibited the osteogenic differen-
tiation of the TLFCs.
3.6  |  LGR5 overexpression enhances the 
Wnt signalling and osteogenic differentiation in 
primary TLFCs
To evaluate the effects of the overexpression of LGR5 on the osteo-
genic differentiation and Wnt signalling pathway, Lv-­
LGR5 was uti-
lized to transfect the primary TLFCs at the initial ossification stage 
for 7 days. As visible in Figure 5A–­
D, the overexpression of LGR5 
strengthened the expression of Wnt related gene and the osteo-
genic markers. These results indicated that the overexpression of

LGR5 would activate the Wnt signalling pathway and promote of the 
osteogenic differentiation potential.
3.7  |  Inhibition of Wnt signalling pathway 
attenuates the osteogenic differentiation induced by 
LGR5 overexpression in primary TLFCs
The tankyrase inhibitor IWR-­
1 was used to further determine 
whether Wnt signalling pathway mediates the enhanced osteogenic 
differentiation of LGR5. The expression level of β-­
catenin in blank 
group and Lv-­
NC group was significantly attenuated with IWR-­
1. 
But the IWR-­
1-­
treated TLFCs without stable LGR5 overexpression 
had insignificant changes in their mRNA and protein levels of LGR5 
compared with blank group and Lv-­
NC group (Figure 6A,B). No sig-
nificant different expression was observed between blank group 
and Lv-­
NC group. LGR5-­
overexpressing TLFCs in IO stage were 
then treated with IWR-­
1, and found that the enhanced expression of 
Wnt related genes and osteogenic markers induced by LGR5 over-
expression was mitigated by introducing of IWR-­
1 (Figure  6C–­
F). 
Taken together, LGR5 promotes the osteogenesis of TLFCs in a Wnt 
signalling-­
dependent manner.
4  |  DISCUSSION
Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum is a rare spinal liga-
ment ectopic ossification that usually causes severe neurological 
dysfunction with poor prognosis, attributed to complex underlying 
pathology and associated factors. The progression of TOLF can be 
characterized as an endochondral ossification process. The histo-
logical process initiated with chondroid metaplasia and infiltration 
of fibroblast-­
like mesenchymal cells into the ligamentum matrix, 
followed by gradual maturation and the synthesis of extracellular 
matrix under the mediation of various transcription factors.10 The 
crucial role of Wnt signalling pathway in the regulation of bone 
maintenance and homeostasis has been recognized.16 However, the 
relationship between upstream signal transduction and spinal liga-
ment degeneration has not yet been clarified. In our present paper, 
we report for the first time that LGR5 is a potent positive media-
tor of osteogenesis in human TLFCs by activating the Wnt signalling 
pathway.
Based on the different morphological characteristics of TOLF an-
alysed by micro-­
CT, the DEGs in the primary TLFCs of different ossi-
fication stages were identified by RNA-­
sequencing, including LGR5, 
RSPO2, Wnt5a, LRP6, FZD3, COL11A1 and Runx2. The emerging

role of LGRs in Wnt signalling-­
associated adult stem cell markers 
in osteogenic differentiation and skeletal regeneration has already 
been indicated in previous studies.20,21 It has been proved that LGR5 
was involved in the formation of articular cartilage, cruciate ligament 
and meniscus of embryonic mice during skeletal development.20 In 
addition, enhanced expression of LGR5 and RSPO2 was detected 
in chondrocytic differentiation of human chondrocytes in advanced 
stage of osteoarthritis, while elevated expression of LGR6 and 
RSPO1 was observed in osteogenic differentiation of SaOS-­
2 cells.21 
Using RNA-­
sequencing analysis, we differentiated the expression of 
LGR5 and RSPO2 in the TLFCs of different stages and recognized 
the importance of LGR5 as a regulator facilitating the differentia-
tion of proliferating chondrocytes in endochondral ossification. We 
found that LGR5 might initiate the phenotype transdifferentiation 
of TLFCs by binding RSPO2, marked the start of endochondral os-
sification. Going towards the advanced stage of ossification, the 
expression of LGR5 was then down regulated. Our IHC results fur-
ther verified that the expression of LGR5 gradually decreased during 
the process from initial to mature ossification as the morphology 
and structure of the TLFCs transformed from fibroblast-­
like cells 
to chondroid-­
 or osteoblast-­
like cells. The ossification process was 
henceforth promoted mainly by the early-­
activated chondrogenic 
markers (e.g. COL11A1) and osteogenic markers (e.g. Runx2, ALP). 
Furthermore, the expression levels of Wnt5a, LRP6 and FZD3were 
promoted during the osteogenic maturation process, which was 
consistent with the results of previous studies exploring the mecha-
nism of Wnt5a and LRP6 in osteoblastogenesis regulation and Wnt 
signalling pathway.22–­
24 Another investigation also reported that de-
creased DNA methylation of Wnt5a might promote the osteogen-
esis in ossified spinal ligaments.25 In according with prior reports, 
our findings recognized LGR5 as a potential regulator promoting the 
osteogenesis of TLFCs at the initial ossification stage by the Wnt 
signalling pathway. Subsequent experiments were therefore per-
formed on TLFCs at IO stage to further explore the effect of LGR5. 
Meanwhile, our results suggested the potential process of transdif-
ferentiation from chondrocytic proliferation to osteoblastic differ-
entiation during the endochondral ossification of TOLF.
LGR5 is a G protein-­
coupled 7-­
transmembrane protein belonging 
to the rhodopsin family, and is a potent Wnt target complex served 
as a significant modulator of Wnt signalling pathway.12,26–­
28 LGR5-­
overexpression enhances the osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem 
cells by promoting the expression of pERK1/2 and β-­
catenin in Wnt/
ERK signalling pathways. Attenuated osteogenic capacity was in-
duced by silencing the LGR5 expression, which possibly attributed 
to increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced mitochon-
drial biogenesis.29 In an LGR-­
null model, LGR5 knock-­
out mice were

nonviable after birth due to cleft palate-­
like phenotype, indicating 
that LGR5 was contributed to the craniofacial formation.30 LGR5 
was also found to be expressed in the periodontal ligament and to be 
critically involved in the skeletal remodelling of the alveolar bone.31 
Our findings confirmed that LGR5 knockdown inhibited the activity 
of the Wnt signalling and prevented the latent osteogenic differenti-
ation of the TLFCs at the initial stage, whereas the opposite effects 
were demonstrated if LGR5 was overexpressed. It is worth noted 
the significance of Wnt signalling pathway in the regulation of bone 
homeostasis. To investigate whether the activation of Wnt signalling 
was required for enhanced osteogenic differentiation of LGR5 over-
expressed TLFCs, we blocked the Wnt signalling pathway using the 
inhibitor IWR-­
1. The results confirmed that the enhanced osteogenic 
differentiation induced by LGR5 overexpression was mitigated by 
IWR-­
1 intervention. Furthermore, the downregulation of Wnt signal-
ling via IWR-­
1 had no effect on the expression of LGR5 in the TLFCs. 
Therefore, the activation of Wnt signalling triggered the osteogenic 
differentiation of TLFCs, which was mediated by LGR5.

RSPOs were first discovered as secreted Wnt signalling agonists 
and were identified as related ligands of LGRs. Previous studies 
showed that LGRs had a high affinity for binding to RSPOs, acti-
vating the Wnt/β-­
catenin and Wnt/PCP signalling pathways.12,15 
Both RSPO1 and RSPO2 were found to promote the osteoblast dif-
ferentiation in synergy by Wnt signalling pathway in vitro.32–­
34 The 
causal single nucleotide polymorphism (rs374810) located in RSPO2 
was identified as a susceptibility gene to mediate chondrogenesis 
by activating Wnt signalling in OPLL.17,35 Data from the MC3T3-­
E1 
cell line again showed that RSPO2 promoted osteoblast formation 
through activating the canonical Wnt/β-­
catenin signalling, and LGR5 
was involved in the RSPO2 mediated β-­
catenin stabilization.36 In 
our study, the elevated expression of RSPO2 and LGR5 at the initial 
ossification stage of TLFCs was verified. It has been reported that 
LGRs could regulate both canonical and non-­
canonical pathway by 
interacting with RSPO and ZNRF3/RNF43, preventing the degrada-
tion of FZDs, thus stimulated both canonical and non-­
canonical Wnt 
ligands at the initiation stage.37 In RNA sequencing analysis of pri-
mary cells of different ossification stages, we found that the expres-
sion of Wnt3a and Wnt5a were consistent with Wnt pathway factors 
(e.g. LRP6 and FZD3) throughout the ossification process, suggest-
ing a synergistic effect that both Wnt canonical and non-­
canonical 
pathway were involved. Taken together, our findings indicated that 
RSPO2 had a critical role in LGR5-­
mediated osteogenesis by induc-
ing Wnt signalling activation. However, the underlying molecular 
mechanisms of these processes still need to be addressed. Further 
studies are recommended to shed light on whether LGR5 regulates 
the Wnt signalling pathway directly through RSPO2.
In conclusion, our present study demonstrated the importance 
of LGR5 in osteogenic differentiation of TLFCs, and provide the first 
evidence that LGR5 be a positive regulator of osteogenesis in TOLF 
by activating Wnt signalling pathway.
